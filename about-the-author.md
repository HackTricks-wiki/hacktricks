# About the author

### Hello!!

This is **Carlos Polop**.

First of all, I want to indicate that **I don't own this entire book**, a lot of **information was copy/pasted from other websites and that content belongs to them** (this is indicated on the pages).

I also wants to say **thanks to all the people that share cyber-security related information for free** on the Internet. Thanks to them I learn new hacking techniques that then I add to Hacktricks.

### BIO

If for some weird reason you are interested in knowing about my bio here you have a summary:

* I've worked in different companies as sysadmin, developer and **pentester**.
* I'm a **Telecommunications Engineer** with a **Masters** in **Cybersecurity**
* Relevant certifications: **OSCP, OSWE**, **CRTP, eMAPT, eWPTXv2** and Professional Drone pilot.
* I speak **Spanish** and **English** and little of French (some day I will improve that).
* I'm a **CTF player**
* I'm very proud of this **book** and my **PEASS** (I'm talking about these peass: [https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite))
