# Uncovering CloudFlare

Techniques to try to uncover web servers behind cloudflare:

* Search for the domain inside [http://www.crimeflare.org:82/cfs.html](http://www.crimeflare.org:82/cfs.html) 
* Search for the domain in [https://leaked.site/index.php?resolver/cloudflare.0/](https://leaked.site/index.php?resolver/cloudflare.0/)
* ****[**CloudFlair**](https://github.com/christophetd/CloudFlair) is a tool that will search using Censys certificates that contains the domain name, then it will search for IPv4s inside those certificates and finally it will try to access the web page in those IPs.
* You can also use some service that gives you the **historical DNS records** of the domain. Maybe the web page is running on an IP address used before.
* If you find a** SSRF inside the web application **you can abuse it to obtain the IP address of the server.
