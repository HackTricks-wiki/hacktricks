# 113 - Pentesting Ident

## Basic Information

Is an [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_%28computing%29) that helps identify the user of a particular [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) connection.

**Default port:** 113

```text
PORT    STATE SERVICE
113/tcp open  ident
```

## **Enumeration**

### **Manual - Get user/Identify the service**

If a machine is running the service ident and samba \(445\) and you are connected to samba using the port 43218. You can get which user is running the samba service by doing:

If you just press enter when you conenct to the service:

### Nmap

By default \(-sC\) nmap will identify every user of every running port:

```text
PORT    STATE SERVICE     VERSION
22/tcp  open  ssh         OpenSSH 4.3p2 Debian 9 (protocol 2.0)
|_auth-owners: root
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   1024 88:23:98:0d:9d:8a:20:59:35:b8:14:12:14:d5:d0:44 (DSA)
|_  2048 6b:5d:04:71:76:78:56:96:56:92:a8:02:30:73:ee:fa (RSA)
113/tcp open  ident
|_auth-owners: identd
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: LOCAL)
|_auth-owners: root
445/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.0.24 (workgroup: LOCAL)
|_auth-owners: root
```

### Ident-user-enum

Ident-user-enum is a simple PERL script to query the ident service \(113/TCP\) in order to determine the owner of the process listening on each TCP port of a target system. The list of usernames gathered can be used for password guessing attacks on other network services. It can be installed with `apt install ident-user-enum`.

```text

ident-user-enum v1.0 ( http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/ident-user-enum )

192.168.1.100:22  root

192.168.1.100:139 root
192.168.1.100:445 root
```
