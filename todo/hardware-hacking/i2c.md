# Bus Pirate

To test a Bus Pirate is working, connect +5V with VPU and 3.3V with ADC and access the bus pirate (Using Tera Term for example) and use the command `~`:

```bash
# Use command
HiZ>~
Disconnect any devices
Connect (Vpu to +5V) and (ADC to +3.3V)
Space to continue
# Press space
Ctrl
AUX OK
MODE LED OK
PULLUP H OK
PULLUP L OK
VREG OK
ADC and supply
5V(4.96) OK
VPU(4.96) OK
3.3V(3.26) OK
ADC(3.27) OK
Bus high
MOSI OK
CLK OK
MISO OK
CS OK
Bus Hi-Z 0
MOSI OK
CLK OK
MISO OK
CS OK
Bus Hi-Z 1
MOSI OK
CLK OK
MISO OK
CS OK
MODE and VREG LEDs should be on!
Any key to exit
#Press space
Found 0 errors.
```

As you can see in the previous command line it said that it found 0 errors. This is very useful to know it's working after buying it or after flashing a firmware.

To connect with the bus pirate you can follow the docs:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (307) (2).png>)

In this case I'm going to connect to an EPROM: ATMEL901 24C256 PU27:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (465) (2) (1).png>)

To talk with bus pirate I used Tera Term connected to the pirate bus COM port with a Setup --> Serial Port --> Speed of 115200.\
In the following communication you can find how to prepare the bus pirate to talk I2C and how to write and read from the memory (Comments appear using "#", don't expect that part in the communication):

```bash

## Sniffer

In this scenario we are going to sniff the I2C communication between the arduino and the previous EPROM, you just need to communicate both devices and then connect the bus pirate to the SCL, SDA and GND pins:

```bash
