## **Basic Information**

Xamarin is an **open-source platform** designed for developers to **build apps for iOS, Android, and Windows** using the .NET and C# frameworks. This platform offers access to numerous tools and extensions to create modern applications efficiently.

### Xamarin's Architecture

* For **Android**, Xamarin integrates with Android and Java namespaces through .NET bindings, operating within the Mono execution environment alongside the Android Runtime (ART). Managed Callable Wrappers (MCW) and Android Callable Wrappers (ACW) facilitate communication between Mono and ART, both of which are built on the Linux kernel.
* For **iOS**, applications run under the Mono runtime, utilizing full Ahead of Time (AOT) compilation to convert C# .NET code into ARM assembly language. This process runs alongside the Objective-C Runtime on a UNIX-like kernel.

### .NET Runtime and Mono Framework

The **.NET framework** includes assemblies, classes, and namespaces for application development, with the .NET Runtime managing code execution. It offers platform independence and backward compatibility. The **Mono Framework** is an open-source version of the .NET framework, initiated in 2005 to extend .NET to Linux, now supported by Microsoft and led by Xamarin.

### Reverse Engineering Xamarin Apps

#### Decompilation of Xamarin Assemblies

Decompilation transforms compiled code back into source code. In Windows, the Modules window in Visual Studio can identify modules for decompilation, allowing for direct access to third-party code and extraction of source code for analysis.

#### JIT vs AOT Compilation

* **Android** supports Just-In-Time (JIT) and Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation, with a Hybrid AOT mode for optimal execution speed. Full AOT is exclusive to Enterprise licenses.
* **iOS** solely employs AOT compilation due to Apple's restrictions on dynamic code execution.

### Extracting dll Files from APK/IPA

To access the assemblies in an APK/IPA, unzip the file and explore the assemblies directory. For Android, tools like [XamAsmUnZ](https://github.com/cihansol/XamAsmUnZ) and [xamarin-decompress](https://github.com/NickstaDB/xamarin-decompress) can uncompress dll files.

```bash
python3 xamarin-decompress.py -o /path/to/decompressed/apk
```

In cases where after decompiling the APK it's possible to see the unknown/assemblies/ folder with the `.dll` files inside it, so it's posible to use [**dnSpy**](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy) directly over the `.dlls` to analyze them.\
However, sometimes, it's found the `assemblies.blob` and `assemblies.manifest` files inside the unknown/assemblies/ folder. The tool [pyxamstore](https://github.com/jakev/pyxamstore) can be used for unpacking the `assemblies.blob` file in Xamarin apps, allowing access to the .NET assemblies for further analysis:

```bash
pyxamstore unpack -d /path/to/decompressed/apk/assemblies/
```

iOS dll files are readily accessible for decompilation, revealing significant portions of the application code, which often shares a common base across different platforms.

### Static Analysis

Once the `.dll`s are obtained it's possible to analyze the .Net code statically using tools such as [**dnSpy**](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy) **or** [**ILSpy**](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) **t**hat will allow to modify the code of the app. This can be super useful to tamper the application to bypass protections for example.\
Note that after modifying the app you will need to pack it back again and sign it again.

### Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis involves checking for SSL pinning and using tools like [Fridax](https://github.com/NorthwaveSecurity/fridax) for runtime modifications of the .NET binary in Xamarin apps. Frida scripts are available to bypass root detection or SSL pinning, enhancing analysis capabilities.

Other interesting Frida scripts:

* [**xamarin-antiroot**](https://codeshare.frida.re/@Gand3lf/xamarin-antiroot/)
* [**xamarin-root-detect-bypass**](https://codeshare.frida.re/@nuschpl/xamarin-root-detect-bypass/)
* [**Frida-xamarin-unpin**](https://github.com/GoSecure/frida-xamarin-unpin)

### Resigning

The tool [Uber APK Signer](https://github.com/patrickfav/uber-apk-signer) simplifies signing multiple APKs with the same key, and can be used to resign an app after changes have been performed to it.
