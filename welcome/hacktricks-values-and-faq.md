These are the **values of the HackTricks Project**:

  * Hacking is about learning, and learning should be as free as possible.
  * The purpose of this book is to serve as a comprehensive **educational resource**.

  * In several cases we will just write **in HackTricks a summary of the important parts** of the technique and will **encourage the lector to visit the original post** for more details.

## HackTricks faq

{% hint style="success" %}
* **Thank you so much for these resources, how can I thank you?**
{% endhint %}

You can publicly thanks HackTricks teams for putting together all these resources publicly in a tweet mentioning [**@hacktricks\_live**](https://twitter.com/hacktricks\_live).\
If you are specially grateful you can also [**sponsor the project here**](https://github.com/sponsors/carlospolop).\
And don't forget to **give a star in the Github projects!** (Find the links below).

{% hint style="success" %}
* **How can I contribute to the project?**
{% endhint %}

You can **share new tips and tricks with the community or fix bugs** you find in the books sending a **Pull Request** to the respective Github pages:&#x20;

* [https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks](https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks)
* [https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks-cloud](https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks-cloud)

Don't forget to **give a star in the Github projects!**

{% hint style="success" %}
* **Can I copy some content from HackTricks and put it in my blog?**
{% endhint %}

Yes, you can, but **don't forget to mention the specific link(s)** where the content was taken from.

{% hint style="warning" %}
* **Can I copy all HackTricks in my blog?**
{% endhint %}

**I would rather not**. Thats **not going to benefit anyone** as all the **content is already publicly available** in the official HackTricks books for free.

If you fear that it will disappear, just fork it in Github or download it, as I said it's already free.

{% hint style="warning" %}
* **Why do you have sponsors? Are HackTricks books for commercial purposes?**
{% endhint %}

The first **HacTricks** **value** is to offer **FREE** hacking educational resources to **ALL** the world. The HackTricks team has **dedicated thousands of hours** to offer this content, again, for **FREE**.

If you think HackTricks books are made for **commercial purposes** you are **COMPLETELY WRONG**.

We have sponsors because, even if all the content is FREE, we want to **offer the community the possibility of appreciating our work** if they want to. Therefore, we offer people the option to donate to HackTricks via [**Github sponsors**](https://github.com/sponsors/carlospolop), and **relevant cybersecurity companies** to sponsor HackTricks and to **have some ads** in the book being the **ads** always placed in places where make them **visible** but **doesn't disturb the learning** process if someone focus in the content.

You won't find HackTricks filled with annoying ads like other blogs with much less content than HackTricks, because HackTricks is not made for commercial purposes.

{% hint style="danger" %}
* **What should I do if some HackTricks page is based on my blog post but it isn't referenced?**
{% endhint %}

**We are very sorry. This shouldn't have happened**. Please, let us know via Github issues, Twitter, Discord... the link of the HackTricks page with the content and the link of your blog and **we will check it and add it ASAP**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
* **What should I do if there is content from my blog in HackTricks and I don't want it there?**
{% endhint %}

In any case know that HackTricks in this case would be improving your **SEO** and **encouraging** people to **check your page**. If you still want the content of your blog to be removed from HackTricks let us know.

Note that asking this we will definitely **remove every link to your blog**, but if the same technique can be found in other web pages we will just change the source of the information and the explanation, so the real content won't probably leave HackTricks (in cybersecurity, in general, there are always several post talking about the same technique).
