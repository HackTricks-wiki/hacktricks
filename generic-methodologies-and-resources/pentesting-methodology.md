### 0- Physical Attacks

Do you have **physical access** to the machine that you want to attack? You should read some [**tricks about physical attacks**](../hardware-physical-access/physical-attacks.md) and others about [**escaping from GUI applications**](../hardware-physical-access/escaping-from-gui-applications.md).

### 1 - [Discovering hosts inside the network ](pentesting-network/#discovering-hosts)/ [Discovering Assets of the company](external-recon-methodology/)

**Depending** if the **test** you are perform is an **internal or external test** you may be interested on finding **hosts inside the company network** (internal test) or **finding assets of the company on the internet** (external test).

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that if you are performing an external test, once you manage to obtain access to the internal network of the company you should re-start this guide.
{% endhint %}

### **2-** [**Having Fun with the network**](pentesting-network/) **(Internal)**

**This section only applies if you are performing an internal test.**\
Before attacking a host maybe you prefer to **steal some credentials** **from the network** or **sniff** some **data** to learn **passively/actively(MitM)** what can you find inside the network. You can read [**Pentesting Network**](pentesting-network/#sniffing).

### 3- [Port Scan - Service discovery](pentesting-network/#scanning-hosts)

The first thing to do when **looking for vulnerabilities in a host** is to know which **services are running** in which ports. Let's see the[ **basic tools to scan ports of hosts**](pentesting-network/#scanning-hosts).

### **4-** [Searching service version exploits](../generic-hacking/search-exploits.md)

Once you know which services are running, and maybe their version, you have to **search for known vulnerabilities**. Maybe you get lucky and there is a exploit to give you a shell...

### **5-** Pentesting Services

If there isn't any fancy exploit for any running service, you should look for **common misconfigurations in each service running.**

**Inside this book you will find a guide to pentest the most common services** (and others that aren't so common)**. Please, search in the left index the** _**PENTESTING**_ **section** (the services are ordered by their default ports).

**I want to make a special mention of the** [**Pentesting Web**](../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/) **part (as it is the most extensive one).**\
Also, a small guide on how to[ **find known vulnerabilities in software**](../generic-hacking/search-exploits.md) can be found here.

**If your service is not inside the index, search in Google** for other tutorials and **let me know if you want me to add it.** If you **can't find anything** in Google, perform your **own blind pentesting**, you could start by **connecting to the service, fuzzing it and reading the responses** (if any).

#### 5.1 Automatic Tools

There are also several tools that can perform **automatic vulnerabilities assessments**. **I would recommend you to try** [**Legion**](https://github.com/carlospolop/legion)**, which is the tool that I have created and it's based on the notes about pentesting services that you can find in this book.**

#### **5.2 Brute-Forcing services**

In some scenarios a **Brute-Force** could be useful to **compromise** a **service**. [**Find here a CheatSheet of different services brute forcing**](../generic-hacking/brute-force.md)**.**

### 6- [Phishing](phishing-methodology/)

If at this point you haven't found any interesting vulnerability you **may need to try some phishing** in order to get inside the network. You can read my phishing methodology [here](phishing-methodology/):

### **7-** [**Getting Shell**](../generic-hacking/reverse-shells/)

Somehow you should have found **some way to execute code** in the victim. Then, [a list of possible tools inside the system that you can use to get a reverse shell would be very useful](../generic-hacking/reverse-shells/).

Specially in Windows you could need some help to **avoid antiviruses**: [**Check this page**](../windows-hardening/av-bypass.md)**.**\\

### 8- Inside

If you have troubles with the shell, you can find here a small **compilation of the most useful commands** for pentesters:

* [**Linux**](../linux-hardening/useful-linux-commands.md)
* [**Windows (CMD)**](../windows-hardening/basic-cmd-for-pentesters.md)
* [**Windows (PS)**](../windows-hardening/basic-powershell-for-pentesters/)

### **9 -** [**Exfiltration**](../generic-hacking/exfiltration.md)

You will probably need to **extract some data from the victim** or even **introduce something** (like privilege escalation scripts). **Here you have a** [**post about common tools that you can use with these purposes**](../generic-hacking/exfiltration.md)**.**

### **10- Privilege Escalation**

#### **10.1- Local Privesc**

If you are **not root/Administrator** inside the box, you should find a way to **escalate privileges.**\
Here you can find a **guide to escalate privileges locally in** [**Linux**](../linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/) **and in** [**Windows**](../windows-hardening/windows-local-privilege-escalation/)**.**\
You should also check this pages about how does **Windows work**:

* [**Authentication, Credentials, Token privileges and UAC**](../windows-hardening/authentication-credentials-uac-and-efs/)
* How does [**NTLM works**](../windows-hardening/ntlm/)
* How to [**steal credentials**](https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks/blob/master/generic-methodologies-and-resources/broken-reference/README.md) in Windows
* Some tricks about [_**Active Directory**_](../windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/)

**Don't forget to checkout the best tools to enumerate Windows and Linux local Privilege Escalation paths:** [**Suite PEAS**](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite)

#### **10.2- Domain Privesc**

Here you can find a [**methodology explaining the most common actions to enumerate, escalate privileges and persist on an Active Directory**](../windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/). Even if this is just a subsection of a section, this process could be **extremely delicate** on a Pentesting/Red Team assignment.

### 11 - POST

#### **11**.1 - Looting

Check if you can find more **passwords** inside the host or if you have **access to other machines** with the **privileges** of your **user**.\
Find here different ways to [**dump passwords in Windows**](https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks/blob/master/generic-methodologies-and-resources/broken-reference/README.md).

#### 11.2 - Persistence

**Use 2 or 3 different types of persistence mechanism so you won't need to exploit the system again.**\
**Here you can find some** [**persistence tricks on active directory**](../windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/#persistence)**.**

TODO: Complete persistence Post in Windows & Linux

### 12 - Pivoting

With the **gathered credentials** you could have access to other machines, or maybe you need to **discover and scan new hosts** (start the Pentesting Methodology again) inside new networks where your victim is connected.\
In this case tunnelling could be necessary. Here you can find [**a post talking about tunnelling**](../generic-hacking/tunneling-and-port-forwarding.md).\
You definitely should also check the post about [Active Directory pentesting Methodology](../windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/). There you will find cool tricks to move laterally, escalate privileges and dump credentials.\
Check also the page about [**NTLM**](../windows-hardening/ntlm/), it could be very useful to pivot on Windows environments..
