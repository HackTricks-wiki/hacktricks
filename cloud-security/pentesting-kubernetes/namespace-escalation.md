# Namespace Escalation

In Kubernetes it's pretty common that somehow **you manage to get inside a namespace** (by stealing some user credentials or by compromising a pod). However, usually you will be interested in **escalating to a different namespace as more interesting things can be found there**.

Here are some techniques you can try to escape to a different namespace:

### Abuse K8s privileges

Obviously if the account you have stolen have sensitive privileges over the namespace you can to escalate to, you can abuse actions like **creating pods** with service accounts in the NS, **executing** a shell in an already existent pod inside of the ns, or read the **secret** SA tokens.

For more info about which privileges you can abuse read:

### Escape to the node

If you can escape to the node either because you have compromised a pod and you can escape or because you ca create a privileged pod and escape you could do several things to steal other SAs tokens:

* Check for **SAs tokens mounted in other docker containers** running in the node
* Check for new **kubeconfig files in the node with extra permissions** given to the node
* If enabled (or enable it yourself) try to **create mirrored pods of other namespaces** as you might get access to those namespaces default token accounts (I haven't tested this yet)

All these techniques are explained in:
