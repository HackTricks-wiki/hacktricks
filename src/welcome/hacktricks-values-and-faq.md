## HackTricks faq

> [!TIP]
>
> - **Thank you so much for these resources, how can I thank you?**

You can publicly thanks HackTricks teams for putting together all these resources publicly in a tweet mentioning [**@hacktricks_live**](https://twitter.com/hacktricks_live).\
If you are specially grateful you can also [**sponsor the project here**](https://github.com/sponsors/carlospolop).\
And don't forget to **give a star in the Github projects!** (Find the links below).

> [!TIP]
>
> - **How can I contribute to the project?**

You can **share new tips and tricks with the community or fix bugs** you find in the books sending a **Pull Request** to the respective Github pages:

- [https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks](https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks)
- [https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks-cloud](https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks-cloud)

Don't forget to **give a star in the Github projects!**

> [!TIP]
>
> - **Can I copy some content from HackTricks and put it in my blog?**

Yes, you can, but **don't forget to mention the specific link(s)** where the content was taken from.

> [!TIP]
>
> - **How can I cite a page of HackTricks?**

As long as the link **of** the page(s) where you took the information from appears it's enough.\
If you need a bibtex you can use something like:

```latex
@misc{hacktricks-bibtexing,
  author = {"HackTricks Team" or the Authors name of the specific page/trick},
  title = {Title of the Specific Page},
  year = {Year of Last Update (check it at the end of the page)},
  url = {\url{https://book.hacktricks.wiki/specific-page}},
}
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> - **Can I copy all HackTricks in my blog?**

**I would rather not**. Thats **not going to benefit anyone** as all the **content is already publicly available** in the official HackTricks books for free.

If you fear that it will disappear, just fork it in Github or download it, as I said it's already free.

> [!WARNING]
>
> - **Why do you have sponsors? Are HackTricks books for commercial purposes?**

The first **HackTricks** **value** is to offer **FREE** hacking educational resources to **ALL** the world. The HackTricks team has **dedicated thousands of hours** to offer this content, again, for **FREE**.

If you think HackTricks books are made for **commercial purposes** you are **COMPLETELY WRONG**.

We have sponsors because, even if all the content is FREE, we want to **offer the community the possibility of appreciating our work** if they want to. Therefore, we offer people the option to donate to HackTricks via [**Github sponsors**](https://github.com/sponsors/carlospolop), and **relevant cybersecurity companies** to sponsor HackTricks and to **have some ads** in the book being the **ads** always placed in places where make them **visible** but **doesn't disturb the learning** process if someone focus in the content.

You won't find HackTricks filled with annoying ads like other blogs with much less content than HackTricks, because HackTricks is not made for commercial purposes.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - **What should I do if some HackTricks page is based on my blog post but it isn't referenced?**

**We are very sorry. This shouldn't have happened**. Please, let us know via Github issues, Twitter, Discord... the link of the HackTricks page with the content and the link of your blog and **we will check it and add it ASAP**.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - **What should I do if there is content from my blog in HackTricks and I don't want it there?**

Note that having links to your page in HackTricks:

- Improve your **SEO**
- The content gets **translated to more than 15 languages** making possible for more people to access this content
- **HackTricks encourages** people to **check your page** (several people has mentioned us that since some page of them is in HackTricks they receive more visits)

However, If you still want the content of your blog to be removed from HackTricks just let us know and we will definitely **remove every link to your blog**, and any content based on it.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - **What should I do if I find copy-pasted content in HackTricks?**

We always **give the original authors all the credits**. If you find a page with copy-pasted content without original source referenced, let us know and we will either **remove it**, **add the link before the text**, or **rewrite it adding the link**.
