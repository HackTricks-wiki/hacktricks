# Hash Length Extension Attack

{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Summary of the attack

Imagine a server which is **signing** some **data** by **appending** a **secret** to some known clear text data and then hashing that data. If you know:

- **The length of the secret** (this can be also bruteforced from a given length range)
- **The clear text data**
- **The algorithm (and it's vulnerable to this attack)**
- **The padding is known**
  - Usually a default one is used, so if the other 3 requirements are met, this also is
  - The padding vary depending on the length of the secret+data, that's why the length of the secret is needed

Then, it's possible for an **attacker** to **append** **data** and **generate** a valid **signature** for the **previous data + appended data**.

### How?

Basically the vulnerable algorithms generate the hashes by firstly **hashing a block of data**, and then, **from** the **previously** created **hash** (state), they **add the next block of data** and **hash it**.

Then, imagine that the secret is "secret" and the data is "data", the MD5 of "secretdata" is 6036708eba0d11f6ef52ad44e8b74d5b.\
If an attacker wants to append the string "append" he can:

- Generate a MD5 of 64 "A"s
- Change the state of the previously initialized hash to 6036708eba0d11f6ef52ad44e8b74d5b
- Append the string "append"
- Finish the hash and the resulting hash will be a **valid one for "secret" + "data" + "padding" + "append"**
