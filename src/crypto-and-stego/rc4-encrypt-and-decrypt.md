# RC4 Encrypt and Decrypt

{#include ../../../../../home/runner/work/HackTricks-Feed/HackTricks-Feed/src/banners/hacktricks-training.md}

If you can somehow encrypt a plaintext using RC4, you can decrypt any content encrypted by that RC4 (using the same password) just using the encryption function.

If you can encrypt a known plaintext you can also extract the password. More references can be found in the HTB Kryptos machine:
