# React Native Application Analysis

{#include ../../../../../../home/runner/work/HackTricks-Feed/HackTricks-Feed/src/banners/hacktricks-training.md}

To confirm if the application was built on the React Native framework, follow these steps:

1. Rename the APK file with a zip extension and extract it to a new folder using the command `cp com.example.apk example-apk.zip` and `unzip -qq example-apk.zip -d ReactNative`.

2. Navigate to the newly created ReactNative folder and locate the assets folder. Inside this folder, you should find the file `index.android.bundle`, which contains the React JavaScript in a minified format.

3. Use the command `find . -print | grep -i ".bundle$"` to search for the JavaScript file.

## Javascript Code

If checking the contents of the `index.android.bundle` you find the JavaScript code of the application (even if minified), you can **analyze it to find sensitive information and vulnerabilities**.

As the bundle contains actually all the JS code of the application it's possible to **divide it in different files** (potentially making easier its reverse engineering) using the **tool [react-native-decompiler](https://github.com/numandev1/react-native-decompiler)**.

### Webpack

To further analyze the JavaScript code, you can upload the file to [https://spaceraccoon.github.io/webpack-exploder/](https://spaceraccoon.github.io/webpack-exploder/) or follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `index.html` in the same directory with the following code:

```html
<script src="./index.android.bundle"></script>
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in Google Chrome.

3. Open the Developer Toolbar by pressing **Command+Option+J for OS X** or **Control+Shift+J for Windows**.

4. Click on "Sources" in the Developer Toolbar. You should see a JavaScript file that is split into folders and files, making up the main bundle.

If you find a file called `index.android.bundle.map`, you will be able to analyze the source code in an unminified format. Map files contain source mapping, which allows you to map minified identifiers.

To search for sensitive credentials and endpoints, follow these steps:

1. Identify sensitive keywords to analyze the JavaScript code. React Native applications often use third-party services like Firebase, AWS S3 service endpoints, private keys, etc.

2. In this specific case, the application was observed to be using the Dialogflow service. Search for a pattern related to its configuration.

3. It was fortunate that sensitive hard-coded credentials were found in the JavaScript code during the recon process.

### Change JS code and rebuild

In this case changing the code is easy. You just need to rename the app to use the extension `.zip` and extract it. Then you can **modify the JS code inside this bundle and rebuild the app**. This should be enough to allow you to **inject code** in the app for testing purpses.


##Â Hermes bytecode

If the bundle contains **Hermes bytecode**, you **won't be able to access the Javascript code** of the app (not even to the minified version).

You can check if the bundle contains Hermes bytecode by running the following command:

```bash
file index.android.bundle
index.android.bundle: Hermes JavaScript bytecode, version 96
```

However, you can use the tools **[hbctool](https://github.com/bongtrop/hbctool)**, **[hermes-dec](https://github.com/P1sec/hermes-dec)** or **[hermes_rs](https://github.com/Pilfer/hermes_rs)** to **disassemble the bytecode** and also to **decompile it to some pseudo JS code**. To do this, for example these commands:

```bash
hbc-disassembler ./index.android.bundle /tmp/my_output_file.hasm
hbc-decompiler ./index.android.bundle /tmp/my_output_file.js
```

### Change code and rebuild

Ideally you should be able to modify the dissasembled code (changing a comparison, or a value or whatever you need to modify) and then **rebuild the bytecode** and then rebuild the app.

The tool **[hbctool](https://github.com/bongtrop/hbctool)** supports dissasembling the bundle and building it back after the changes have been performed, however it **only supports old versions** of Hermes bytecode.

The tool **[hermes-dec](https://github.com/P1sec/hermes-dec)** doesn't support rebuilding the bytecode.

The tool **[hermes_rs](https://github.com/Pilfer/hermes_rs)** supports rebuilding the bytecode, but it's actually a library and nto a CLI tool.

## Dyanmic Analysis

You could try to dynamically analyze the app would be to use Frida to enable the developer mode of the React app and use **`react-native-debugger`** to attach to it. However, for this you need the source code of the app apparently. You can find more info about this in [https://newsroom.bedefended.com/hooking-react-native-applications-with-frida/](https://newsroom.bedefended.com/hooking-react-native-applications-with-frida/).
