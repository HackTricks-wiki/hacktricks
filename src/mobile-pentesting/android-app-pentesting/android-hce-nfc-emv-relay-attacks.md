# Detection / hunting ideas

- **Static triage:** look for third-party APKs distributed via phishing that combine `android.permission.NFC`, host-based card emulation features, React Native/Hermes artifacts, and minimal Java/Kotlin logic.
- **Network analytics:** alert on outbound WebSockets to uncertified hosts on tcp/3000 carrying small JSON blobs with fields like `type`, `id`, `sessionId`, and APDU-looking hex (e.g., `00A40400`, `9000`).
- **Fraud telemetry:** monitor for EMV contactless transactions whose authorization cryptograms map to a card holder that never left the original geography, or for sequences where a PIN prompt on the device precedes remote POS usage.
