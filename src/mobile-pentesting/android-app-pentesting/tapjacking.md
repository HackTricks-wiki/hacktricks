# Tapjacking

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}


## **Basic Information**

**Tapjacking** is an attack where a **malicious** **application** is launched and **positions itself on top of a victim application**. Once it visibly obscures the victim app, its user interface is designed in such a way as to trick the user to interact with it, while it is passing the interaction along to the victim app.\
In effect, it is **blinding the user from knowing they are actually performing actions on the victim app**.

### Detection

In order to detect apps vulnerable to this attacked you should search for **exported activities** in the android manifest (note that an activity with an intent-filter is automatically exported by default). Once you have found the exported activities, **check if they require any permission**. This is because the **malicious application will need that permission also**.

You can also check the minimum SDK version of the app, checking the value of **`android:minSdkVersion`** in the **`AndroidManifest.xml`** file. If the value is **lower than 30**, the app is vulnerable to Tapjacking.

### Protection

#### Android 12 (API 31,32) and higher

[**According to this source**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tapjacking-in-android/)**,** tapjacking attacks are automatically prevented by Android from Android 12 (API 31 & 30) and higher. So, even if the application is vulnerable you **won't be able to exploit it**.

#### `filterTouchesWhenObscured`

If **`android:filterTouchesWhenObscured`** is set to **`true`**, the `View` will not receive touches whenever view's window is obscured by another visible window.

#### **`setFilterTouchesWhenObscured`**

The attribute **`setFilterTouchesWhenObscured`** set to true can also prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability if the Android version is lower.\
If set to **`true`**, for example, a button can be automatically **disabled if it is obscured**:

```xml
<Button android:text="Button"
android:id="@+id/button1"
android:layout_width="wrap_content"
android:layout_height="wrap_content"
android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true">
</Button>
```

## Exploitation

### Tapjacking-ExportedActivity

The most **recent Android application** performing a Tapjacking attack (+ invoking before an exported activity of the attacked application) can be found in: [**https://github.com/carlospolop/Tapjacking-ExportedActivity**](https://github.com/carlospolop/Tapjacking-ExportedActivity).

Follow the **README instructions to use it**.

### FloatingWindowApp

An example project implementing **FloatingWindowApp**, which can be used to put on top of other activities to perform a clickjacking attack, can be found in [**FloatingWindowApp**](https://github.com/aminography/FloatingWindowApp) (a bit old, good luck building the apk).

### Qark

> [!CAUTION]
> It looks like this project is now unmaintained and this functionality isn't properly working anymore

You can use [**qark**](https://github.com/linkedin/qark) with the `--exploit-apk` --sdk-path `/Users/username/Library/Android/sdk` parameters to create a malicious application to test for possible **Tapjacking** vulnerabilities.\

The mitigation is relatively simple as the developer may choose not to receive touch events when a view is covered by another. Using the [Android Developer’s Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#security):

> Sometimes it is essential that an application be able to verify that an action is being performed with the full knowledge and consent of the user, such as granting a permission request, making a purchase or clicking on an advertisement. Unfortunately, a malicious application could try to spoof the user into performing these actions, unaware, by concealing the intended purpose of the view. As a remedy, the framework offers a touch filtering mechanism that can be used to improve the security of views that provide access to sensitive functionality.
>
> To enable touch filtering, call [`setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(boolean)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#setFilterTouchesWhenObscured%28boolean%29) or set the android:filterTouchesWhenObscured layout attribute to true. When enabled, the framework will discard touches that are received whenever the view's window is obscured by another visible window. As a result, the view will not receive touches whenever a toast, dialog or other window appears above the view's window.

## Accessibility Overlay Phishing (Banking-Trojan Variant)

Besides classic Tapjacking, modern Android banking malware families (e.g. **ToxicPanda**, BrasDex, Sova, etc.) abuse the **Accessibility Service** to place a full-screen WebView **overlay** above the legitimate application while still being able to **forward the user input** to the view underneath.  This dramatically increases believability and allows attackers to steal credentials, OTPs or even automate fraudulent transactions.

### How it works
1. The malicious APK requests the highly-sensitive `BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE` permission, usually hiding the request behind a fake Google/Chrome/PDF-viewer dialog.
2. Once the user enables the service, the malware programmatically simulates the taps required to grant additional dangerous permissions (`READ_SMS`, `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`, `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`, …).
3. A **WebView** is inflated and added to the window manager using the **`TYPE_ACCESSIBILITY_OVERLAY`** window type.  The overlay can be rendered totally opaque or semi-transparent and can be flagged as *“through”* so that the original touches are still delivered to the background activity (thus the transaction really happens while the victim only sees the phishing form).

```java
WebView phishingView = new WebView(getApplicationContext());
phishingView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
phishingView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/bank_login.html");

WindowManager wm = (WindowManager) getSystemService(WINDOW_SERVICE);
WindowManager.LayoutParams lp = new WindowManager.LayoutParams(
        WindowManager.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,
        WindowManager.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,
        WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_ACCESSIBILITY_OVERLAY,  // <-- bypasses SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW prompt
        WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE |
        WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_NOT_TOUCH_MODAL,        // «through» flag → forward touches
        PixelFormat.TRANSLUCENT);
wm.addView(phishingView, lp);
```

### Typical workflow used by banking Trojans
* Query installed packages (`QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`) to figure out which banking / wallet app is currently opened.
* Download an **HTML/JS overlay template** from the C2 that perfectly imitates that specific application (Logo, colours, i18n strings…).
* Display the overlay, harvest credentials/PIN/pattern.
* Use the **Accessibility API** (`performGlobalAction`, `GestureDescription`) to automate transfers in the background.

### Detection & Mitigation
* Audit the list of installed apps with `adb shell pm list packages -3 -e BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE`.
* From the application side (bank / wallet):
  - Enable **`android:accessibilityDataSensitive="accessibilityDataPrivateYes"`** (Android 14+) on sensitive views to block non-Play-Store services.
  - Combine with `setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(true)` and `FLAG_SECURE`.
* System hardening:
  - Disable *Install from Unknown Sources* & *Accessibility for untrusted apps*.
  - Enforce PlayProtect & up-to-date devices.
