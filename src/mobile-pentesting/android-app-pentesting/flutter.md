# Flutter

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

Flutter is **Google’s cross-platform UI toolkit** that lets developers write a single Dart code-base which the **Engine** (native C/C++) turns into platform-specific machine code for Android & iOS.  
The Engine bundles a **Dart VM**, **BoringSSL**, Skia, etc., and ships as the shared library **libflutter.so** (Android) or **Flutter.framework** (iOS). All actual networking (DNS, sockets, TLS) happens **inside this library**, *not* in the usual Java/Kotlin Swift/Obj-C layers. That siloed design is why the usual Java-level Frida hooks fail on Flutter apps.

## Intercepting HTTPS traffic in Flutter

This is a summary of this [blog post](https://sensepost.com/blog/2025/intercepting-https-communication-in-flutter-going-full-hardcore-mode-with-frida/).

### Why HTTPS interception is tricky in Flutter  
* **SSL/TLS verification lives two layers down** in BoringSSL, so Java SSL‐pinning bypasses don’t touch it.  
* **BoringSSL uses its *own* CA store** inside libflutter.so; importing your Burp/ZAP CA into Android’s system store changes nothing.  
* Symbols in libflutter.so are **stripped & mangled**, hiding the certificate-verification function from dynamic tools.

### Fingerprint the exact Flutter stack  
Knowing the version lets you re-build or pattern-match the right binaries.

Step | Command / File | Outcome
----|----|----
Get snapshot hash | `python3 get_snapshot_hash.py libapp.so` | `adb4292f3ec25…`
Map hash → Engine | **enginehash** list in reFlutter | Flutter 3 · 7 · 12 + engine commit `1a65d409…`
Pull dependent commits | DEPS file in that engine commit | • `dart_revision` → Dart v2 · 19 · 6<br>• `dart_boringssl_rev` → BoringSSL `87f316d7…`

Find [get_snapshot_hash.py here](https://github.com/Impact-I/reFlutter/blob/main/scripts/get_snapshot_hash.py).

### Target: `ssl_crypto_x509_session_verify_cert_chain()`  
* Located in **`ssl_x509.cc`** inside BoringSSL.  
* **Returns `bool`** – a single `true` is enough to bypass the whole certificate chain check.  
* Same function exists on every CPU arch; only the opcodes differ.

### Option A – Binary patching with **reFlutter**  
1. **Clone** the exact Engine & Dart sources for the app’s Flutter version.
2. **Regex-patch** two hotspots:
   * In `ssl_x509.cc`, force `return 1;`  
   * (Optional) In `socket_android.cc`, hard-code a proxy (`"10.0.2.2:8080"`).
3. **Re-compile** libflutter.so, drop it back into the APK/IPA, sign, install.
4. **Pre-patched builds** for common versions are shipped in the reFlutter GitHub releases to save hours of build time.

### Option B – Live hooking with **Frida** (the “hard-core” path)  
Because the symbol is stripped, you pattern-scan the loaded module for its first bytes, then change the return value on the fly.

```javascript
// attach & locate libflutter.so
var flutter = Process.getModuleByName("libflutter.so");

// x86-64 pattern of the first 16 bytes of ssl_crypto_x509_session_verify_cert_chain
var sig = "55 41 57 41 56 41 55 41 54 53 48 83 EC 38 C6 02";

Memory.scan(flutter.base, flutter.size, sig, {
  onMatch: function (addr) {
    console.log("[+] found verifier at " + addr);
    Interceptor.attach(addr, {
      onLeave: function (retval) { retval.replace(0x1); }  // always 'true'
    });
  },
  onComplete: function () { console.log("scan done"); }
});
```

Run it:

```bash
frida -U -f com.example.app -l bypass.js
```

*Porting tips*  
* For **arm64-v8a** or **armv7**, grab the first ~32 bytes of the function from Ghidra, convert to a space-separated hex string, and replace `sig`.  
* Keep **one pattern per Flutter release**, store them in a cheat-sheet for fast reuse.

### Forcing traffic through your proxy  
Flutter itself **ignores device proxy settings**. Easiest options:  
* **Android Studio emulator:** Settings ▶ Proxy → manual.  
* **Physical device:** evil Wi-Fi AP + DNS spoofing, or Magisk module editing `/etc/hosts`.

### Quick Flutter TLS bypass workflow (Frida Codeshare + system CA)  
When you only need to observe a pinned Flutter API, combining a rooted/writable AVD, a system-trusted proxy CA, and a drop-in Frida script is often faster than reverse-engineering libflutter.so:

1. **Install your proxy CA in the system store.** Follow [Install Burp Certificate](install-burp-certificate.md) to hash/rename Burp's DER certificate and push it into `/system/etc/security/cacerts/` (writable `/system` required).

2. **Drop a matching `frida-server` binary and run it as root** so it can attach to the Flutter process:

```bash
adb push frida-server-17.0.5-android-x86_64 /data/local/tmp/frida-server
adb shell "su -c 'chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server && /data/local/tmp/frida-server &'"
```

3. **Install the host-side tooling and enumerate the target package.**

```bash
pip3 install frida-tools --break-system-packages
adb shell pm list packages -f | grep target
```

4. **Spawn the Flutter app with the Codeshare hook that neuters BoringSSL pin checks.**

```bash
frida -U -f com.example.target --codeshare TheDauntless/disable-flutter-tls-v1 --no-pause
```

The Codeshare script overrides the Flutter TLS verifier so every certificate (including Burp's dynamically generated ones) is accepted, side-stepping public-key pin comparisons.

5. **Route traffic through your proxy.** Configure the emulator Wi-Fi proxy GUI or enforce it via `adb shell settings put global http_proxy 10.0.2.2:8080`; if direct routing fails, fall back to `adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080` or a host-only VPN.

Once the CA is trusted at the OS layer and Frida quashes Flutter's pinning logic, Burp/mitmproxy regains full visibility for API fuzzing (BOLA, token tampering, etc.) without repacking the APK.

### Offset-based hook of BoringSSL verification (no signature scan)
When pattern-based scripts fail across architectures (e.g., x86_64 vs ARM), directly hook the BoringSSL chain verifier by absolute address within libflutter.so. Workflow:

- Extract the right-ABI library from the APK: `unzip -j app.apk "lib/*/libflutter.so" -d libs/` and pick the one matching the device (e.g., `lib/x86_64/libflutter.so`).
- Analyze in Ghidra/IDA and locate the verifier:
  - Source: BoringSSL ssl_x509.cc function `ssl_crypto_x509_session_verify_cert_chain` (3 args, returns bool).
  - In stripped builds, search for the string `"ssl_client"` and inspect XREFs; identify the function taking three pointer-like args and returning a boolean.
- Compute the runtime offset: take the function address shown by Ghidra and subtract the image base used during analysis to get the relative offset (RVA). Example: `0x02184644 - 0x00100000 = 0x02084644`.
- Hook at runtime by base + offset and force success:

```javascript
// frida -U -f com.target.app -l bypass.js --no-pause
const base = Module.findBaseAddress('libflutter.so');
// Example offset from analysis. Recompute per build/arch.
const off  = ptr('0x02084644');
const addr = base.add(off);

// ssl_crypto_x509_session_verify_cert_chain: 3 args, bool return
Interceptor.replace(addr, new NativeCallback(function (a, b, c) {
  return 1; // true
}, 'int', ['pointer', 'pointer', 'pointer']));

console.log('[+] Hooked BoringSSL verify_cert_chain at', addr);
```

Notes
- Recompute the offset for every target build and CPU architecture; compiler/codegen differences break hardcoded signatures.
- This bypass causes BoringSSL to accept any chain, enabling HTTPS MITM regardless of pins/CA trust inside Flutter.
- If you force-route traffic during debugging to confirm TLS blocking, e.g.:

```bash
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -j DNAT --to-destination <Burp_IP>:<Burp_Port>
```

…you will still need the hook above, since verification happens inside libflutter.so, not Android’s system trust store.
