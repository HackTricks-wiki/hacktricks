# Bypass Biometric Authentication (Android)

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}


## **Method 1 – Bypassing with No Crypto Object Usage**

The focus here is on the _onAuthenticationSucceeded_ callback, which is crucial in the authentication process. Researchers at WithSecure developed a [Frida script](https://github.com/WithSecureLABS/android-keystore-audit/blob/master/frida-scripts/fingerprint-bypass.js), enabling the bypass of the NULL _CryptoObject_ in _onAuthenticationSucceeded(...)_. The script forces an automatic bypass of the fingerprint authentication upon the method's invocation. Below is a simplified snippet demonstrating the bypass in an Android Fingerprint context, with the full application available on [GitHub](https://github.com/St3v3nsS/InsecureBanking).

```javascript
biometricPrompt = new BiometricPrompt(this, executor, new BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback() {
            @Override
            public void onAuthenticationSucceeded(@NonNull BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationResult result) {
                Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this,"Success",Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
            }
});
```

Command to run the Frida script:

```bash
frida -U -f com.generic.insecurebankingfingerprint --no-pause -l fingerprint-bypass.js
```

## **Method 2 – Exception Handling Approach**

Another [Frida script](https://github.com/WithSecureLABS/android-keystore-audit/blob/master/frida-scripts/fingerprint-bypass-via-exception-handling.js) by WithSecure addresses bypassing insecure crypto object usage. The script invokes _onAuthenticationSucceeded_ with a _CryptoObject_ that hasn't been authorized by a fingerprint. If the application tries to use a different cipher object, it will trigger an exception. The script prepares to invoke _onAuthenticationSucceeded_ and handle the _javax.crypto.IllegalBlockSizeException_ in the _Cipher_ class, ensuring subsequent objects used by the application are encrypted with the new key.

Command to run the Frida script:

```bash
frida -U -f com.generic.insecurebankingfingerprint --no-pause -l fingerprint-bypass-via-exception-handling.js
```

Upon reaching the fingerprint screen and the initiation of `authenticate()`, type `bypass()`` in the Frida console to activate the bypass:

```
Spawning com.generic.insecurebankingfingerprint...
[Android Emulator 5554::com.generic.insecurebankingfingerprint]-> Hooking BiometricPrompt.authenticate()...
Hooking BiometricPrompt.authenticate2()...
Hooking FingerprintManager.authenticate()...
[Android Emulator 5554::com.generic.insecurebankingfingerprint]-> bypass()
```

## **Method 3 – Instrumentation Frameworks**

Instrumentation frameworks like Xposed or Frida can be used to hook into application methods at runtime. For fingerprint authentication, these frameworks can:

1. **Mock the Authentication Callbacks**: By hooking into the `onAuthenticationSucceeded`, `onAuthenticationFailed`, or `onAuthenticationError` methods of the `BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback`, you can control the outcome of the fingerprint authentication process.
2. **Bypass SSL Pinning**: This allows an attacker to intercept and modify the traffic between the client and the server, potentially altering the authentication process or stealing sensitive data.

Example command for Frida:

```bash
frida -U -l script-to-bypass-authentication.js --no-pause -f com.generic.in
```

## **Method 4 – Reverse Engineering & Code Modification**

Reverse engineering tools like `APKTool`, `dex2jar`, and `JD-GUI` can be used to decompile an Android application, read its source code, and understand its authentication mechanism. The steps generally include:

1. **Decompiling the APK**: Convert the APK file to a more human-readable format (like Java code).
2. **Analyzing the Code**: Look for the implementation of fingerprint authentication and identify potential weaknesses (like fallback mechanisms or improper validation checks).
3. **Recompiling the APK**: After modifying the code to bypass fingerprint authentication, the application is recompiled, signed, and installed on the device for testing.

## **Method 5 – Using Custom Authentication Tools**

There are specialized tools and scripts designed to test and bypass authentication mechanisms. For instance:

1. **MAGISK Modules**: MAGISK is a tool for Android that allows users to root their devices and add modules that can modify or spoof hardware-level information, including fingerprints.
2. **Custom-built Scripts**: Scripts can be written to interact with the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) or directly with the application's backend to simulate or bypass fingerprint authentication.
