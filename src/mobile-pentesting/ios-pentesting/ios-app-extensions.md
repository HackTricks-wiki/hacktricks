# iOS App Extensions

{#include ../../../../../../home/runner/work/HackTricks-Feed/HackTricks-Feed/src/banners/hacktricks-training.md}

App extensions enhance the functionality of apps by allowing them to interact with other apps or the system, providing custom features or content. These extensions include:

- **Custom Keyboard**: Offers a unique keyboard across all apps, replacing the default iOS keyboard.
- **Share**: Enables sharing to social networks or with others directly.
- **Today (Widgets)**: Delivers content or performs tasks quickly from the Notification Center's Today view.

When a user engages with these extensions, such as sharing text from a host app, the extension processes this input within its context, leveraging the shared information to perform its task, as detailed in Apple's documentation.

### **Security Considerations**

Key security aspects include:

- Extensions and their containing apps communicate via inter-process communication, not directly.
- The **Today widget** is unique in that it can request its app to open via a specific method.
- Shared data access is allowed within a private container, but direct access is restricted.
- Certain APIs, including HealthKit, are off-limits to app extensions, which also cannot start long-running tasks, access the camera, or microphone, except for iMessage extensions.

### Static Analysis

#### **Identifying App Extensions**

To find app extensions in source code, search for `NSExtensionPointIdentifier` in Xcode or inspect the app bundle for `.appex` files indicating extensions. Without source code, use grep or SSH to locate these identifiers within the app bundle.

#### **Supported Data Types**

Check the `Info.plist` file of an extension for `NSExtensionActivationRule` to identify supported data types. This setup ensures only compatible data types trigger the extension in host apps.

#### **Data Sharing**

Data sharing between an app and its extension requires a shared container, set up via "App Groups" and accessed through `NSUserDefaults`. This shared space is necessary for background transfers initiated by extensions.

#### **Restricting Extensions**

Apps can restrict certain extension types, particularly custom keyboards, ensuring sensitive data handling aligns with security protocols.

### Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis involves:

- **Inspecting Shared Items**: Hook into `NSExtensionContext - inputItems` to see shared data types and origins.
- **Identifying Extensions**: Discover which extensions process your data by observing internal mechanisms, like `NSXPCConnection`.

Tools like `frida-trace` can aid in understanding the underlying processes, especially for those interested in the technical details of inter-process communication.
