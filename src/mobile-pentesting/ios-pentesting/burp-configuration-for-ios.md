## Installing the Burp Certificate on iOS Devices

For secure web traffic analysis and SSL pinning on iOS devices, the Burp Suite can be utilized either through the **Burp Mobile Assistant** or via manual configuration. Below is a summarized guide on both methods:

### Automated Installation with Burp Mobile Assistant

The **Burp Mobile Assistant** simplifies the installation process of the Burp Certificate, proxy configuration, and SSL Pinning. Detailed guidance can be found on [PortSwigger's official documentation](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/mobile-assistant/installing).

### Manual Installation Steps

1. **Proxy Configuration:** Start by setting Burp as the proxy under the iPhone's Wi-Fi settings.
2. **Certificate Download:** Navigate to `http://burp` on your device's browser to download the certificate.
3. **Certificate Installation:** Install the downloaded profile via **Settings** > **General** > **VPN & Device Management**, then enable trust for the PortSwigger CA under **Certificate Trust Settings**.

### Configuring an Interception Proxy

The setup enables traffic analysis between the iOS device and the internet through Burp, requiring a Wi-Fi network that supports client-to-client traffic. If unavailable, a USB connection via usbmuxd can serve as an alternative. PortSwigger's tutorials provide in-depth instructions on [device configuration](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1841108-configuring-an-ios-device-to-work-with-burp) and [certificate installation](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1841109-installing-burp-s-ca-certificate-in-an-ios-device).

### Advanced Configuration for Jailbroken Devices

For users with jailbroken devices, SSH over USB (via **iproxy**) offers a method to route traffic directly through Burp:

1.  **Establish SSH Connection:** Use iproxy to forward SSH to localhost, allowing connection from the iOS device to the computer running Burp.

    ```bash
    iproxy 2222 22
    ```

2.  **Remote Port Forwarding:** Forward the iOS device's port 8080 to the computer's localhost to enable direct access to Burp's interface.

    ```bash
    ssh -R 8080:localhost:8080 root@localhost -p 2222
    ```

3.  **Global Proxy Setting:** Lastly, configure the iOS device's Wi-Fi settings to use a manual proxy, directing all web traffic through Burp.

### Full Network Monitoring/Sniffing

Monitoring of non-HTTP device traffic can be efficiently conducted using **Wireshark**, a tool capable of capturing all forms of data traffic. For iOS devices, real-time traffic monitoring is facilitated through the creation of a Remote Virtual Interface, a process detailed in [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9555403/capturing-mobile-phone-traffic-on-wireshark/33175819#33175819). Prior to beginning, installation of **Wireshark** on a macOS system is a prerequisite.

The procedure involves several key steps:

1. Initiate a connection between the iOS device and the macOS host via USB.
2. Ascertain the iOS device's **UDID**, a necessary step for traffic monitoring. This can be done by executing a command in the macOS Terminal:

```bash
$ rvictl -s <UDID>
Starting device <UDID> [SUCCEEDED] with interface rvi0
```

3. Post-identification of the UDID, **Wireshark** is to be opened, and the "rvi0" interface selected for data capture.
4. For targeted monitoring, such as capturing HTTP traffic related to a specific IP address, Wireshark's Capture Filters can be employed:

## Burp Cert Installation in Simulator

- **Export Burp Certificate**

In _Proxy_ --> _Options_ --> _Export CA certificate_ --> _Certificate in DER format_

![](<../../images/image (534).png>)

- **Drag and Drop** the certificate inside the Emulator
- **Inside the emulator** go to _Settings_ --> _General_ --> _Profile_ --> _PortSwigger CA_, and **verify the certificate**
- **Inside the emulator** go to _Settings_ --> _General_ --> _About_ --> _Certificate Trust Settings_, and **enable PortSwigger CA**

**Congrats, you have successfully configured the Burp CA Certificate in the iOS simulator**

> [!TIP]
> **The iOS simulator will use the proxy configurations of the MacOS.**

### MacOS Proxy Configuration

Steps to configure Burp as proxy:

- Go to _System Preferences_ --> _Network_ --> _Advanced_
- In _Proxies_ tab mark _Web Proxy (HTTP)_ and _Secure Web Proxy (HTTPS)_
- In both options configure _127.0.0.1:8080_
