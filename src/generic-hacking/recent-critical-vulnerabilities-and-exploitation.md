## CVE-2025-6463: Arbitrary File Deletion in Forminator WordPress Plugin

- **Type:** Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion
- **Impact:** Allows deletion of any file on the web server, including critical files like `wp-config.php`.
- **Exploitation:** Sending crafted HTTP requests to vulnerable plugin endpoints triggers file deletion.
- **Consequence:** Deleting `wp-config.php` can lead to remote code execution (RCE) and full site compromise.

### Technical Details
Attackers exploit an unauthenticated flaw in the Forminator plugin to delete arbitrary files by manipulating HTTP requests. This disrupts site configuration and can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.

## CVE-2025-5349 and CVE-2025-5777: Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway Vulnerabilities

- **CVE-2025-5349:** Improper access control in the management interface allowing unauthorized access.
- **CVE-2025-5777:** Memory over-read due to insufficient input validation when configured as a Gateway, exposing sensitive data.

### Impact and Mitigation
Both vulnerabilities are critical and require urgent patching. Exploitation can lead to unauthorized access and data leakage. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) such as Check Point IPS provide protection against CVE-2025-5777.

## CVE-2025-47812: Wing FTP Server Remote Code Execution

- **Type:** Authentication Bypass via Null-Byte Injection
- **Impact:** Allows login without valid credentials and privilege escalation.
- **Exploitation:** Null-byte injection in the username field bypasses authentication. Post-login, attackers use the UID cookie to escalate privileges.
- **Discovery:** Found through anonymous access fuzzing.

### Technical Insights
This vulnerability demonstrates the exploitation of null-byte injection to bypass authentication mechanisms, enabling attackers to gain authenticated user access and execute arbitrary commands.

## RondoDox Botnet Exploitation

- **Targets:** TBK DVRs and Four-Faith routers
- **Exploited Vulnerabilities:** CVE-2024-3721 and CVE-2024-12856
- **Capabilities:** Establishes persistence, disguises traffic as gaming or VPN packets, downloads payloads via secure connections, and enables DDoS attacks.

### Threat Behavior
The botnet uses sophisticated evasion techniques to avoid detection and maintain control over infected devices, leveraging IoT vulnerabilities for large-scale attacks.

## Additional Threat Intelligence Highlights

- Surge in cybercrime targeting Amazon Prime Day 2025 with phishing domains mimicking Amazon.
- Analysis of the "Scattered Spider" APT group using social engineering and living-off-the-land techniques.
- Hunters International ransomware group shutting down and releasing questionable decryption tools.

---

## Mitigation Recommendations

- Apply patches promptly for all critical vulnerabilities.
- Deploy and update Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block exploitation attempts.
- Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns indicative of botnet activity.
- Educate users about phishing threats, especially during major events like Amazon Prime Day.
