# Cryptographic/Compression Algorithms

## Identifying Algorithms

If you ends in a code **using shift rights and lefts, xors and several arithmetic operations** it's highly possible that it's the implementation of a **cryptographic algorithm**. Here it's going to be showed some ways to **identify the algorithm that it's used without needing to reverse each step**.

### API functions

**CryptDeriveKey**

If this function is used, you can find which **algorithm is being used** checking the value of the second parameter:

![](<../../images/image (375) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

Check here the table of possible algorithms and their assigned values: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/alg-id](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/alg-id)

**RtlCompressBuffer/RtlDecompressBuffer**

Compresses and decompresses a given buffer of data.

**CryptAcquireContext**

From [the docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptacquirecontexta): The **CryptAcquireContext** function is used to acquire a handle to a particular key container within a particular cryptographic service provider (CSP). **This returned handle is used in calls to CryptoAPI** functions that use the selected CSP.

**CryptCreateHash**

Initiates the hashing of a stream of data. If this function is used, you can find which **algorithm is being used** checking the value of the second parameter:

### Code constants

Sometimes it's really easy to identify an algorithm thanks to the fact that it needs to use a special and unique value.

![](<../../images/image (370).png>)

If you search for the first constant in Google this is what you get:

![](<../../images/image (371).png>)

Therefore, you can assume that the decompiled function is a **sha256 calculator.**\
You can search any of the other constants and you will obtain (probably) the same result.

### data info

If the code doesn't have any significant constant it may be **loading information from the .data section**.\
You can access that data, **group the first dword** and search for it in google as we have done in the section before:

![](<../../images/image (372).png>)

In this case, if you look for **0xA56363C6** you can find that it's related to the **tables of the AES algorithm**.

## RC4 **(Symmetric Crypt)**

### Characteristics

It's composed of 3 main parts:

- **Initialization stage/**: Creates a **table of values from 0x00 to 0xFF** (256bytes in total, 0x100). This table is commonly call **Substitution Box** (or SBox).
- **Scrambling stage**: Will **loop through the table** crated before (loop of 0x100 iterations, again) creating modifying each value with **semi-random** bytes. In order to create this semi-random bytes, the RC4 **key is used**. RC4 **keys** can be **between 1 and 256 bytes in length**, however it is usually recommended that it is above 5 bytes. Commonly, RC4 keys are 16 bytes in length.
- **XOR stage**: Finally, the plain-text or cyphertext is **XORed with the values created before**. The function to encrypt and decrypt is the same. For this, a **loop through the created 256 bytes** will be performed as many times as necessary. This is usually recognized in a decompiled code with a **%256 (mod 256)**.

> [!TIP]
> **In order to identify a RC4 in a disassembly/decompiled code you can check for 2 loops of size 0x100 (with the use of a key) and then a XOR of the input data with the 256 values created before in the 2 loops probably using a %256 (mod 256)**

### **Initialization stage/Substitution Box:** (Note the number 256 used as counter and how a 0 is written in each place of the 256 chars)

### **Scrambling Stage:**

### **XOR Stage:**

## **AES (Symmetric Crypt)**

### **Characteristics**

- Use of **substitution boxes and lookup tables**
  - It's possible to **distinguish AES thanks to the use of specific lookup table values** (constants). _Note that the **constant** can be **stored** in the binary **or created**_ _**dynamically**._
- The **encryption key** must be **divisible** by **16** (usually 32B) and usually an **IV** of 16B is used.

### SBox constants

## Serpent **(Symmetric Crypt)**

### Characteristics

- It's rare to find some malware using it but there are examples (Ursnif)
- Simple to determine if an algorithm is Serpent or not based on it's length (extremely long function)

### Identifying

In the following image notice how the constant **0x9E3779B9** is used (note that this constant is also used by other crypto algorithms like **TEA** -Tiny Encryption Algorithm).\
Also note the **size of the loop** (**132**) and the **number of XOR operations** in the **disassembly** instructions and in the **code** example:

![](<../../images/image (381).png>)

As it was mentioned before, this code can be visualized inside any decompiler as a **very long function** as there **aren't jumps** inside of it. The decompiled code can look like the following:

![](<../../images/image (382).png>)

Therefore, it's possible to identify this algorithm checking the **magic number** and the **initial XORs**, seeing a **very long function** and **comparing** some **instructions** of the long function **with an implementation** (like the shift left by 7 and the rotate left by 22).

## RSA **(Asymmetric Crypt)**

### Characteristics

- More complex than symmetric algorithms
- There are no constants! (custom implementation are difficult to determine)
- KANAL (a crypto analyzer) fails to show hints on RSA ad it relies on constants.

### Identifying by comparisons

![](<../../images/image (383).png>)

- In line 11 (left) there is a `+7) >> 3` which is the same as in line 35 (right): `+7) / 8`
- Line 12 (left) is checking if `modulus_len < 0x040` and in line 36 (right) it's checking if `inputLen+11 > modulusLen`

## MD5 & SHA (hash)

### Characteristics

- 3 functions: Init, Update, Final
- Similar initialize functions

### Identify

**Init**

You can identify both of them checking the constants. Note that the sha_init has 1 constant that MD5 doesn't have:

![](<../../images/image (385).png>)

**MD5 Transform**

Note the use of more constants

![](<../../images/image (253) (1) (1) (1).png>)

## CRC (hash)

- Smaller and more efficient as it's function is to find accidental changes in data
- Uses lookup tables (so you can identify constants)

### Identify

Check **lookup table constants**:

![](<../../images/image (387).png>)

A CRC hash algorithm looks like:

![](<../../images/image (386).png>)

## APLib (Compression)

### Characteristics

- Not recognizable constants
- You can try to write the algorithm in python and search for similar things online

### Identify

The graph is quiet large:

Check **3 comparisons to recognise it**:
