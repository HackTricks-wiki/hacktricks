**UDP Scans**\
nc -nv -u -z -w 1 \<IP> 160-16

An empty UDP packet is sent to a specific port. If the UDP port is open, no reply is sent back from the target machine. If the UDP port is closed, an ICMP port unreachable packet should be sent back from the target machine.\

UDP port scanning is often unreliable, as firewalls and routers may drop ICMP\
 packets. This can lead to false positives in your scan, and you will regularly see\
 UDP port scans showing all UDP ports open on a scanned machine.\
 o Most port scanners do not scan all available ports, and usually have a preset list\
 of “interesting ports” that are scanned.

# CTF - Tricks

In **Windows** use **Winzip** to search for files.\
**Alternate data Streams**: _dir /r | find ":$DATA"_\

```
binwalk --dd=".*" <file> #Extract everything
binwalk -M -e -d=10000 suspicious.pdf #Extract, look inside extracted files and continue extracing (depth of 10000)
```
