## Security considerations for cookies (technical guidance)

Although this document is primarily a legal notice, HackTricks is a security-focused project and we want to provide actionable advice for defenders and penetration testers who work with cookies every day.

### Common attack vectors

* **Session hijacking & side-jacking** ‚Äì stealing a victim‚Äôs session ID via XSS, MitM or leaked Referer headers.
* **Session fixation** ‚Äì forcing a user to authenticate using a cookie value chosen by the attacker.
* **CSRF & SameSite bypasses** ‚Äì abusing relaxed SameSite policies or browser implementation flaws (e.g. Samsung Internet CVE-2023-30674) to perform state-changing requests cross-site. ÓàÄciteÓàÇturn1search0ÓàÅ
* **Cookie tossing / prefix confusion** ‚Äì planting a cookie on a parent domain so that it shadows a more secure cookie.
* **Cookie poisoning** ‚Äì manipulating cookie values (e.g. in JWTs stored in cookies) to escalate privileges.

### Recommended defensive attributes

| Attribute | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `Secure` | Prevents transmission over plain HTTP. | `Set-Cookie: id=abc; Secure` |
| `HttpOnly` | Blocks JavaScript access (mitigates XSS session theft). | `Set-Cookie: id=abc; HttpOnly` |
| `SameSite=Strict \| Lax` | Mitigates CSRF by withholding cookies on cross-site requests. | `Set-Cookie: id=abc; SameSite=Lax` |
| `SameSite=None; Secure` | Allows cross-site use **only** when truly required (payment, SSO). Must be combined with `Secure`. | `Set-Cookie: token=xyz; SameSite=None; Secure` |
| `Partitioned` | New (Chrome 114+) attribute from *Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State* (CHIPS). Enables a third-party cookie to be double-keyed per top-level site, surviving the upcoming third-party cookie phase-out while blocking cross-site tracking. | `Set-Cookie: __Host-example=34d8g; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=None; Partitioned` ÓàÄciteÓàÇturn0search1ÓàÅ |
| `__Host-` / `__Secure-` prefixes | Enforce `Secure`, `Path=/` and (for `__Host-`) the absence of `Domain`, limiting the scope and preventing cookie-shadowing. | `Set-Cookie: __Host-sid=abc; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax` |

> üí° Tip: Combine *multiple* attributes. A modern, highly secure session cookie looks like:
>
> `Set-Cookie: __Host-session=s%3A123‚Ä¶; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax;`  
> or, for an embedded third-party service that must persist after Chrome‚Äôs 2025 3PCD rollout:  
> `Set-Cookie: __Host-chat=34d8g; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=None; Partitioned;` 

### Browser changes you should be aware of (2024‚Äì2025)

* **Chrome 118+ Privacy Sandbox (‚Äú3PCD‚Äù) experiments** ‚Äì Google has started rolling out the removal of unrestricted third-party cookies. Sites that rely on `SameSite=None` cookies should migrate to CHIPS (`Partitioned`), the Storage Access API, or other Privacy-Sandbox alternatives.
* **`Partitioned` attribute shipped (Chrome 114, June 2024)** ‚Äì gives developers a forward-compatible way to keep legitimate cross-site state without enabling tracking. Other Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Brave) have followed quickly.
* **RFC 6265bis drafts (2024-2025)** ‚Äì the IETF HTTPBIS working group is standardising new attributes (`Partitioned`, updated `SameSite` semantics, cookie prefixes) and clarifying historical ambiguities.

### Testing & debugging tools

* **Chrome DevTools ‚ÄúCookies‚Äù panel & Issues tab** ‚Äì surfaces deprecation warnings for `SameSite=None` and shows partitioning status.
* **Privacy Sandbox Analysis Tool (PSAT)** ‚Äì a DevTools extension that simulates the 3PCD environment and helps audit third-party cookie usage. ÓàÄciteÓàÇturn3search1ÓàÅ
