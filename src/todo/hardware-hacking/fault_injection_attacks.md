Fault injections attacks includes introducing external distrubance in electronic circuits to influence it's behaviour, resulting to disclose information or even bypass certian restrictions in the circuit. This attacks opens a lot of possibilities for attacking electronic circuits. This attack is also referred as glitching of electronic circuits.

There are a lot of methods and mediums for injecting fault into an electronic circuit.
