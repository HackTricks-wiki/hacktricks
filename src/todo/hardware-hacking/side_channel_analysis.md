# Side Channel Analysis Attacks 

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

Side Channel Analysis Attacks refers to determining the information from a device or entity by some other channel or source that has an indirect influence on it and information can be extracted from it. This can be explained better with an example: 

Analysing the vibrations in glass sheets which is near the sound source, but the sound source is not accessible. The vibrations in glass are influenced by the sound source and if monitored and analysed, the sound can be decoded and interpreted.

These attacks are very popular in case of leaking data such as private keys or finding operations in the processors. An electronic circuit is has a lot of channels from which, information is constantly leaked. Monitoring and analysing can be useful for diclosing a lot of information about the circuit and internals of it.
