It's possible to interact with **CheckPoint** **Firewall-1** firewalls to discover valuable information such as the firewall's name and the management station's name. This can be done by sending a query to the port **264/TCP**.

## Obtaining Firewall and Management Station Names

Using a pre-authentication request, you can execute a module that targets the **CheckPoint Firewall-1**. The necessary commands for this operation are outlined below:

```bash
use auxiliary/gather/checkpoint_hostname
set RHOST 10.10.10.10
```

Upon execution, the module attempts to contact the firewall's SecuRemote Topology service. If successful, it confirms the presence of a CheckPoint Firewall and retrieves the names of both the firewall and the SmartCenter management host. Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```text
[*] Attempting to contact Checkpoint FW1 SecuRemote Topology service...
[+] Appears to be a CheckPoint Firewall...
[+] Firewall Host: FIREFIGHTER-SEC
[+] SmartCenter Host: FIREFIGHTER-MGMT.example.com
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

## Alternative Method for Hostname and ICA Name Discovery

Another technique involves a direct command that sends a specific query to the firewall and parses the response to extract the firewall's hostname and ICA name. The command and its structure are as follows:

```bash
printf '\x51\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x21\x00\x00\x00\x0bsecuremote\x00' | nc -q 1 10.10.10.10 264 | grep -a CN | cut -c 2-
```

The output from this command provides detailed information regarding the firewall's certificate name (CN) and organization (O), as demonstrated below:

```text
CN=Panama,O=MGMTT.srv.rxfrmi
```
