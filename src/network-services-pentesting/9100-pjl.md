# 9100/tcp - PJL (Printer Job Language)

{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

From [here](http://hacking-printers.net/wiki/index.php/Port_9100_printing): Raw printing is what we define as the process of making a connection to port 9100/tcp of a network printer. It is the default method used by CUPS and the Windows printing architecture to communicate with network printers as it is considered as ‘_the simplest, fastest, and generally the most reliable network protocol used for printers_’. Raw port 9100 printing, also referred to as JetDirect, AppSocket or PDL-datastream actually **is not a printing protocol by itself**. Instead **all data sent is directly processed by the printing device**, just like a parallel connection over TCP. In contrast to LPD, IPP and SMB, this can send direct feedback to the client, including status and error messages. Such a **bidirectional channel** gives us direct **access** to **results** of **PJL**, **PostScript** or **PCL** commands. Therefore raw port 9100 printing – which is supported by almost any network printer – is used as the channel for security analysis with PRET and PFT.

## Printers Hacking tool

This is the tool you want to use to abuse printers: [PRET](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/PRET)

## XPS/TrueType VM exploitation (Canon ImageCLASS)

- Deliver XPS over PJL:
  - `@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE = XPS`
  - Then send the XPS ZIP bytes on the same TCP connection.

- Minimal XPS page referencing an attacker font:

```xml
<Glyphs Fill="#ff000000" FontUri="/Resources/evil.ttf" FontRenderingEmSize="12" OriginX="10" OriginY="10"/>
```

- RCE primitive summary (TrueType hinting VM):
  - Hinting bytecode in TTF is executed by a TrueType VM. Canon’s VM lacked stack bounds checks.
  - CINDEX: OOB stack read → info leak
  - DELTAP1: unchecked relative stack pivot → controlled writes with subsequent pushes
  - Combine `WS`/`RS` (VM storage write/read) to stage values and perform a precise 32-bit write after pivot.

- Exploit outline:
  1) Create XPS with the page above and include `/Resources/evil.ttf`.
  2) In `fpgm`/`prep`, use `CINDEX` to leak and compute `stack_cur`.
  3) Stage target value with `WS`; pivot with `DELTAP1` to the destination; use `RS` to write it (e.g., to a function pointer) to gain PC control.

- Send over 9100/tcp:

```bash
{ printf "@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE = XPS\r\n"; cat exploit.xps; } | nc -q0 <PRINTER_IP> 9100
```

- `exploit.xps` is a valid XPS ZIP containing `Documents/1/Pages/1.fpage` and `/Resources/evil.ttf`.
