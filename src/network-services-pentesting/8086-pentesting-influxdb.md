# 8086 - Pentesting InfluxDB
{{#include /banners/hacktricks-training.md}}


{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

**InfluxDB** is an open-source **time series database (TSDB)** developed by InfluxData. TSDBs are optimized for storing and serving time series data, which consists of timestamp-value pairs. Compared to general-purpose databases, TSDBs provide significant improvements in **storage space** and **performance** for time series datasets. They employ specialized compression algorithms and can be configured to automatically remove old data. Specialized database indices also enhance query performance.

**Default port**: 8086

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
8086/tcp open  http    InfluxDB http admin 1.7.5
```

## Enumeration

From a pentester point of view this another database that could be storing sensitive information, so it's interesting to know how to dump all the info.

### Authentication

InfluxDB might require authentication or not

```bash
# Try unauthenticated
influx -host 'host name' -port 'port #'
> use _internal
```

If you **get an error like** this one: `ERR: unable to parse authentication credentials` it means that it's **expecting some credentials**.

```
influx –username influx –password influx_pass
```

There was a vulnerability influxdb that allowed to bypass the authentication: [**CVE-2019-20933**](https://github.com/LorenzoTullini/InfluxDB-Exploit-CVE-2019-20933)

### Manual Enumeration

The information of this example was taken from [**here**](https://oznetnerd.com/2017/06/11/getting-know-influxdb/).

#### Show databases

The found databases are `telegraf` and `internal` (you will find this one everywhere)

```bash
> show databases
name: databases
name
----
telegraf
_internal
```

#### Show tables/measurements

The [**InfluxDB documentation**](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.2/introduction/getting_started/) explains that **measurements** in InfluxDB can be paralleled with SQL tables. The nomenclature of these **measurements** is indicative of their respective content, each housing data relevant to a particular entity.

```bash
> show measurements
name: measurements
name
----
cpu
disk
diskio
kernel
mem
processes
swap
system
```

#### Show columns/field keys

The field keys are like the **columns** of the database

```bash
> show field keys
name: cpu
fieldKey         fieldType
--------         ---------
usage_guest      float
usage_guest_nice float
usage_idle       float
usage_iowait     float

name: disk
fieldKey     fieldType
--------     ---------
free         integer
inodes_free  integer
inodes_total integer
inodes_used  integer

[ ... more keys ...]
```

#### Dump Table

And finally you can **dump the table** doing something like

```bash
select * from cpu
name: cpu
time                cpu       host   usage_guest usage_guest_nice usage_idle        usage_iowait        usage_irq usage_nice usage_softirq        usage_steal usage_system        usage_user
----                ---       ----   ----------- ---------------- ----------        ------------        --------- ---------- -------------        ----------- ------------        ----------
1497018760000000000 cpu-total ubuntu 0           0                99.297893681046   0                   0         0          0                    0           0.35105315947842414 0.35105315947842414
1497018760000000000 cpu1      ubuntu 0           0                99.69909729188728 0                   0         0          0                    0           0.20060180541622202 0.10030090270811101
```

> [!WARNING]
> In some testing with the authentication bypass it was noted that the name of the table needed to be between double quotes like: `select * from "cpu"`

### Automated Authentication

```bash
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/http/influxdb_enum
```
