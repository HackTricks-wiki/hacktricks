## NetBios Name Service

**NetBIOS Name Service** plays a crucial role, involving various services such as **name registration and resolution**, **datagram distribution**, and **session services**, utilizing specific ports for each service.

[From Wikidepia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS_over_TCP/IP):

- Name service for name registration and resolution (ports: 137/udp and 137/tcp).
- Datagram distribution service for connectionless communication (port: 138/udp).
- Session service for connection-oriented communication (port: 139/tcp).

### Name Service

For a device to participate in a NetBIOS network, it must have a unique name. This is achieved through a **broadcast process** where a "Name Query" packet is sent. If no objections are received, the name is considered available. Alternatively, a **Name Service server** can be queried directly to check for name availability or to resolve a name to an IP address. Tools like `nmblookup`, `nbtscan`, and `nmap` are utilized for enumerating NetBIOS services, revealing server names and MAC addresses.

```bash
PORT    STATE SERVICE    VERSION
137/udp open  netbios-ns Samba nmbd netbios-ns (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
```

Enumerating a NetBIOS service you can obtain the names the server is using and the MAC address of the server.

```bash
nmblookup -A <IP>
nbtscan <IP>/30
sudo nmap -sU -sV -T4 --script nbstat.nse -p137 -Pn -n <IP>
```

### Datagram Distribution Service

NetBIOS datagrams allow for connectionless communication via UDP, supporting direct messaging or broadcasting to all network names. This service uses port **138/udp**.

```bash
PORT    STATE         SERVICE     VERSION
138/udp open|filtered netbios-dgm
```

### Session Service

For connection-oriented interactions, the **Session Service** facilitates a conversation between two devices, leveraging **TCP** connections through port **139/tcp**. A session begins with a "Session Request" packet and can be established based on the response. The service supports larger messages, error detection, and recovery, with TCP handling flow control and packet retransmission.

Data transmission within a session involves **Session Message packets**, with sessions being terminated by closing the TCP connection.

These services are integral to **NetBIOS** functionality, enabling efficient communication and resource sharing across a network. For more information on TCP and IP protocols, refer to their respective [TCP Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) and [IP Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) pages.

```bash
PORT      STATE SERVICE      VERSION
139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn  Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
```
