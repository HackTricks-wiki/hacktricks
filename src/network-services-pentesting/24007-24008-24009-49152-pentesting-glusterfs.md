# 24007-24008-24009-49152 - Pentesting GlusterFS

{#include ../../../../../home/runner/work/HackTricks-Feed/HackTricks-Feed/src/banners/hacktricks-training.md}

## Basic Information

**GlusterFS** is a **distributed file system** that combines storage from multiple servers into one **unified system**. It allows for **arbitrary scalability**, meaning you can easily add or remove storage servers without disrupting the overall file system. This ensures high **availability** and **fault tolerance** for your data. With GlusterFS, you can access your files as if they were stored locally, regardless of the underlying server infrastructure. It provides a powerful and flexible solution for managing large amounts of data across multiple servers.

**Default ports**: 24007/tcp/udp, 24008/tcp/udp, 49152/tcp (onwards)\
For the port 49152, ports incremented by 1 need to be open to use more bricks. _Previously the port 24009 was used instead of 49152._

```
PORT      STATE  SERVICE
24007/tcp open   rpcbind
49152/tcp open   ssl/unknown
```

## Enumeration

To interact with this filesystem you need to install the [**GlusterFS client**](https://download.gluster.org/pub/gluster/glusterfs/LATEST/) (`sudo apt-get install glusterfs-cli`).

To list and mount the available volumes you can use:

```bash
sudo gluster --remote-host=10.10.11.131 volume list
# This will return the name of the volumes

sudo mount -t glusterfs 10.10.11.131:/<vol_name> /mnt/
```

If you receive an **error trying to mount the filesystem**, you can check the logs in `/var/log/glusterfs/`

**Errors mentioning certificates** can be fixed by stealing the files (if you have access to the system):

- /etc/ssl/glusterfs.ca
- /etc/ssl/glusterfs.key
- /etc/ssl/glusterfs.ca.pem

And storing them in your machine `/etc/ssl` or `/usr/lib/ssl` directory (if a different directory is used check for lines similar to: "_could not load our cert at /usr/lib/ssl/glusterfs.pem_" in the logs) .
