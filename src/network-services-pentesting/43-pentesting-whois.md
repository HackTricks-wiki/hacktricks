# 43 - Pentesting WHOIS

{{#include /banners/hacktricks-training.md}}



## Basic Information

The **WHOIS** protocol serves as a standard method for **inquiring about the registrants or holders of various Internet resources** through specific databases. These resources encompass domain names, blocks of IP addresses, and autonomous systems, among others. Beyond these, the protocol finds application in accessing a broader spectrum of information.

**Default port:** 43

```
PORT   STATE  SERVICE
43/tcp open   whois?
```

## Enumerate

Get all the information that a whois service has about a domain:

```bash
whois -h <HOST> -p <PORT> "domain.tld"
echo "domain.ltd" | nc -vn <HOST> <PORT>
```

Notice than sometimes when requesting for some information to a WHOIS service the database being used appears in the response:

![](<../images/image (301).png>)

Also, the WHOIS service always needs to use a **database** to store and extract the information. So, a possible **SQLInjection** could be present when **querying** the database from some information provided by the user. For example doing: `whois -h 10.10.10.155 -p 43 "a') or 1=1#"` you could be able to **extract all** the **information** saved in the database.
