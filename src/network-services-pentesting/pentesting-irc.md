# 194,6667,6660-7000 - Pentesting IRC

{#include ../../../../../home/runner/work/HackTricks-Feed/HackTricks-Feed/src/banners/hacktricks-training.md}

## Basic Information

IRC, initially a **plain text protocol**, was assigned **194/TCP** by IANA but is commonly run on **6667/TCP** and similar ports to avoid needing **root privileges** for operation.

A **nickname** is all that's needed to connect to a server. Following connection, the server performs a reverse-DNS lookup on the user's IP.

Users are divided into **operators**, who need a **username** and **password** for more access, and regular **users**. Operators have varying levels of privileges, with administrators at the top.

**Default ports:** 194, 6667, 6660-7000

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE
6667/tcp open  irc
```

## Enumeration

### Banner

IRC can support **TLS**.

```bash
nc -vn <IP> <PORT>
openssl s_client -connect <IP>:<PORT> -quiet
```

### Manual

Here you can see how to connect and access the IRC using some **random nickname** and then enumerate some interesting info. You can learn more commands of IRC [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_commands#USERIP).

```bash
#Connection with random nickname
USER ran213eqdw123 0 * ran213eqdw123
NICK ran213eqdw123
#If a PING :<random> is responded you need to send
#PONG :<received random>
