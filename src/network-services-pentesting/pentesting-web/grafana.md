## Interesting stuff

- The file **`/etc/grafana/grafana.ini`** can contain sensitive information such as **admin** **username** and **password.**
- Inside the platform you could **invite people** or **generate API keys** (might need to be admin)
- You could check which plugins are installed (or even install new)
- By default it uses **SQLite3** database in **`/var/lib/grafana/grafana.db`**
  - `select user,password,database from data_source;`
