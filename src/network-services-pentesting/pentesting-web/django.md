## Cache Manipulation to RCE
Django's default cache storage method is [Python pickles](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html), which can lead to RCE if [untrusted input is unpickled](https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-11/Slaviero/BH_US_11_Slaviero_Sour_Pickles_Slides.pdf). **If an attacker can gain write access to the cache, they can escalate this vulnerability to RCE on the underlying server**. 

Django cache is stored in one of four places: [Redis](https://github.com/django/django/blob/48a1929ca050f1333927860ff561f6371706968a/django/core/cache/backends/redis.py#L12), [memory](https://github.com/django/django/blob/48a1929ca050f1333927860ff561f6371706968a/django/core/cache/backends/locmem.py#L16), [files](https://github.com/django/django/blob/48a1929ca050f1333927860ff561f6371706968a/django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py#L16), or a [database](https://github.com/django/django/blob/48a1929ca050f1333927860ff561f6371706968a/django/core/cache/backends/db.py#L95). Cache stored in a Redis server or database are the most likely attack vectors (Redis injection and SQL injection), but an attacker may also be able to use file-based cache to turn an arbitrary write into RCE. Maintainers have marked this as a non-issue. It's important to note that the cache file folder, SQL table name, and Redis server details will vary based on implementation.
