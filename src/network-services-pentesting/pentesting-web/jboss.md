## Enumeration and Exploitation Techniques

When assessing the security of web applications, certain paths like _/web-console/ServerInfo.jsp_ and _/status?full=true_ are key for revealing **server details**. For JBoss servers, paths such as _/admin-console_, _/jmx-console_, _/management_, and _/web-console_ can be crucial. These paths might allow access to **management servlets** with default credentials often set to **admin/admin**. This access facilitates interaction with MBeans through specific servlets:

- For JBoss versions 6 and 7, **/web-console/Invoker** is used.
- In JBoss 5 and earlier versions, **/invoker/JMXInvokerServlet** and **/invoker/EJBInvokerServlet** are available.

Tools like **clusterd**, available at [https://github.com/hatRiot/clusterd](https://github.com/hatRiot/clusterd), and the Metasploit module `auxiliary/scanner/http/jboss_vulnscan` can be used for enumeration and potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in JBOSS services.

### Exploitation Resources

To exploit vulnerabilities, resources such as [JexBoss](https://github.com/joaomatosf/jexboss) provide valuable tools.

### Finding Vulnerable Targets

Google Dorking can aid in identifying vulnerable servers with a query like: `inurl:status EJInvokerServlet`
