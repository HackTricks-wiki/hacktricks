**To dump a .git folder from a URL use** [**https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper**](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper)

**Use** [**https://www.gitkraken.com/**](https://www.gitkraken.com/) **to inspect the content**

If a _.git_ directory is found in a web application you can download all the content using _wget -r http://web.com/.git._ Then, you can see the changes made by using _git diff_.

The tools: [Git-Money](https://github.com/dnoiz1/git-money), [DVCS-Pillage](https://github.com/evilpacket/DVCS-Pillage) and [GitTools](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools) can be used to retrieve the content of a git directory.

The tool [https://github.com/cve-search/git-vuln-finder](https://github.com/cve-search/git-vuln-finder) can be used to search for CVEs and security vulnerability messages inside commits messages.

The tool [https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob) search for sensitive data in the repositories of an organisations and its employees.

[Repo security scanner](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/repo-security-scanner) is a command line-based tool that was written with a single goal: to help you discover GitHub secrets that developers accidentally made by pushing sensitive data. And like the others, it will help you find passwords, private keys, usernames, tokens and more.

### Faster /.git dumping & dirlisting bypass (2024–2026)

* [holly-hacker/git-dumper](https://github.com/holly-hacker/git-dumper) is a 2024 rewrite of the classic GitTools dumper with parallel fetching (>10x speedup). Example: `python3 git-dumper.py https://victim/.git/ out && cd out && git checkout -- .`
* [Ebryx/GitDump](https://github.com/Ebryx/GitDump) brute-forces object names from `.git/index`, `packed-refs`, etc. to recover repos even when directory traversal is disabled: `python3 git-dump.py https://victim/.git/ dump && cd dump && git checkout -- .`

### Quick post-dump triage

```bash
cd dumpdir
# reconstruct working tree
git checkout -- .
# show branch/commit map
git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all
# list suspicious config/remotes/hooks
git config -l
ls .git/hooks
```

### Secret/credential hunting (current tooling)

* **TruffleHog v3+**: entropy+regex with automatic Git history traversal. `trufflehog git file://$PWD --only-verified --json > secrets.json`
* **Gitleaks** (v8+): fast regex ruleset, can scan unpacked tree or full history. `gitleaks detect -v --source . --report-format json --report-path gitleaks.json`
