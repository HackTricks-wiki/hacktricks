## HTTP Verbs/Methods Fuzzing

Try using **different verbs** to access the file: `GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE, PATCH, INVENTED, HACK`

- Check the response headers, maybe some information can be given. For example, a **200 response** to **HEAD** with `Content-Length: 55` means that the **HEAD verb can access the info**. But you still need to find a way to exfiltrate that info.
- Using a HTTP header like `X-HTTP-Method-Override: PUT` can overwrite the verb used.
- Use **`TRACE`** verb and if you are very lucky maybe in the response you can see also the **headers added by intermediate proxies** that might be useful.

## HTTP Headers Fuzzing

- **Change Host header** to some arbitrary value ([that worked here](https://medium.com/@sechunter/exploiting-admin-panel-like-a-boss-fc2dd2499d31))
- Try to [**use other User Agents**](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Fuzzing/User-Agents/UserAgents.fuzz.txt) to access the resource.
- **Fuzz HTTP Headers**: Try using HTTP Proxy **Headers**, HTTP Authentication Basic and NTLM brute-force (with a few combinations only) and other techniques. To do all of this I have created the tool [**fuzzhttpbypass**](https://github.com/carlospolop/fuzzhttpbypass).

  - `X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1`
  - `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1`
  - `X-Forwarded: 127.0.0.1`
  - `Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1`
  - `X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1`
  - `X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1`
  - `X-ProxyUser-Ip: 127.0.0.1`
  - `X-Original-URL: 127.0.0.1`
  - `Client-IP: 127.0.0.1`
  - `True-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1`
  - `Cluster-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1`
  - `X-ProxyUser-Ip: 127.0.0.1`
  - `Host: localhost`

  If the **path is protected** you can try to bypass the path protection using these other headers:

  - `X-Original-URL: /admin/console`
  - `X-Rewrite-URL: /admin/console`

- If the page is **behind a proxy**, maybe it's the proxy the one preventing you you to access the private information. Try abusing [**HTTP Request Smuggling**](../../pentesting-web/http-request-smuggling/index.html) **or** [**hop-by-hop headers**](../../pentesting-web/abusing-hop-by-hop-headers.md)**.**
- Fuzz [**special HTTP headers**](special-http-headers.md) looking for different response.
  - **Fuzz special HTTP headers** while fuzzing **HTTP Methods**.
- **Remove the Host header** and maybe you will be able to bypass the protection.

## Path **Fuzzing**

If _/path_ is blocked:

- Try using `/%2e/path` (if the access is blocked by a proxy, this could bypass the protection). Try also `/%252e**/path` (double URL encode)
- Try **Unicode bypass**: _/**%ef%bc%8f**path_ (The URL encoded chars are like "/") so when encoded back it will be _//path_ and maybe you will have already bypassed the _/path_ name check
- **Other path bypasses**:
  - site.com/secret –> HTTP 403 Forbidden
  - site.com/SECRET –> HTTP 200 OK
  - site.com/secret/ –> HTTP 200 OK
  - site.com/secret/. –> HTTP 200 OK
  - site.com//secret// –> HTTP 200 OK
  - site.com/./secret/.. –> HTTP 200 OK
  - site.com/;/secret –> HTTP 200 OK
  - site.com/.;/secret –> HTTP 200 OK
  - site.com//;//secret –> HTTP 200 OK
  - site.com/secret.json –> HTTP 200 OK (ruby)
  - Use all [**this list**](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Fuzzing/Unicode.txt) in the following situations:
    - /FUZZsecret
    - /FUZZ/secret
    - /secretFUZZ
- **Other API bypasses:**
  - /v3/users_data/1234 --> 403 Forbidden
  - /v1/users_data/1234 --> 200 OK
  - {“id”:111} --> 401 Unauthriozied
  - {“id”:\[111]} --> 200 OK
  - {“id”:111} --> 401 Unauthriozied
  - {“id”:{“id”:111\}} --> 200 OK
  - {"user_id":"\<legit_id>","user_id":"\<victims_id>"} (JSON Parameter Pollution)
  - user_id=ATTACKER_ID\&user_id=VICTIM_ID (Parameter Pollution)

## **Parameter Manipulation**

- Change **param value**: From **`id=123` --> `id=124`**
- Add additional parameters to the URL: `?`**`id=124` —-> `id=124&isAdmin=true`**
- Remove the parameters
- Re-order parameters
- Use special characters.
- Perform boundary testing in the parameters — provide values like _-234_ or _0_ or _99999999_ (just some example values).

## **Protocol version**

If using HTTP/1.1 **try to use 1.0** or even test if it **supports 2.0**.

## **Other Bypasses**

- Get the **IP** or **CNAME** of the domain and try **contacting it directly**.
- Try to **stress the server** sending common GET requests ([It worked for this guy wit Facebook](https://medium.com/@amineaboud/story-of-a-weird-vulnerability-i-found-on-facebook-fc0875eb5125)).
- **Change the protocol**: from http to https, or for https to http
- Go to [**https://archive.org/web/**](https://archive.org/web/) and check if in the past that file was **worldwide accessible**.

## **Brute Force**

- **Guess the password**: Test the following common credentials. Do you know something about the victim? Or the CTF challenge name?
- [**Brute force**](../../generic-hacking/brute-force.md#http-brute)**:** Try basic, digest and NTLM auth.

```:Common creds
admin    admin
admin    password
admin    1234
admin    admin1234
admin    123456
root     toor
test     test
guest    guest
```
