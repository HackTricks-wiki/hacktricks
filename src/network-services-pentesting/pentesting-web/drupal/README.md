## Discovery

- Check **meta**

```bash
curl https://www.drupal.org/ | grep 'content="Drupal'
```

- **Node**: Drupal **indexes its content using nodes**. A node can **hold anything** such as a blog post, poll, article, etc. The page URIs are usually of the form `/node/<nodeid>`.

```bash
curl drupal-site.com/node/1
```

## Enumeration

### Version

- Check `/CHANGELOG.txt`

```bash
curl -s http://drupal-site.local/CHANGELOG.txt | grep -m2 ""

Drupal 7.57, 2018-02-21
```

> [!NOTE]
> Newer installs of Drupal by default block access to the `CHANGELOG.txt` and `README.txt` files.

### Username enumeration

Drupal supports **three types of users** by default:

1. **`Administrator`**: This user has complete control over the Drupal website.
2. **`Authenticated User`**: These users can log in to the website and perform operations such as adding and editing articles based on their permissions.
3. **`Anonymous`**: All website visitors are designated as anonymous. By default, these users are only allowed to read posts.

**To enumerate users you can:**

- **Get number of users:** Just access `/user/1`, `/user/2`, `/user/3`... until it returns an error indicating that the suer doesn't exist.
- **Registry**: Access`/user/register` and try to create a username and if the name is already taken it will be indicated in an error from the server.
- **Reset password**: Try to reset the password of a user and if the user doesn't exist it will be indicated clearly in an error message.

### Hidden pages

Just find new pages by looking into **`/node/FUZZ`** where **`FUZZ`** is a number (from 1 to 1000 for example).

### Installed modules info

```bash
#From https://twitter.com/intigriti/status/1439192489093644292/photo/1
#Get info on installed modules
curl https://example.com/config/sync/core.extension.yml
curl https://example.com/core/core.services.yml

# Download content from files exposed in the previous step
curl https://example.com/config/sync/swiftmailer.transport.yml
```

## Automatic Tools

```bash
droopescan scan drupal -u http://drupal-site.local
```

- [**Drupalwned**](https://github.com/nowak0x01/Drupalwned): Drupal Exploitation Script that **elevate XSS to RCE or Others Critical Vulnerabilities.** For more info check [**this post**](https://nowak0x01.github.io/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d.html). It provides **support for Drupal Versions 7.X.X, 8.X.X, 9.X.X and 10.X.X, and allows to:**
  - _**Privilege Escalation:**_ Creates an administrative user in Drupal.

## Post Exploitation

### Read settings.php

```bash
find / -name settings.php -exec grep "drupal_hash_salt\|'database'\|'username'\|'password'\|'host'\|'port'\|'driver'\|'prefix'" {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

### Dump users from DB

```bash
mysql -u drupaluser --password='2r9u8hu23t532erew' -e 'use drupal; select * from users'
```
