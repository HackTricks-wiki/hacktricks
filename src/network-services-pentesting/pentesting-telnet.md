## **Basic Information**

Telnet is a network protocol that gives users a UNsecure way to access a computer over a network.

**Default port:** 23

```
23/tcp open  telnet
```

## **Enumeration**

### **Banner Grabbing**

```bash
nc -vn <IP> 23
```

All the interesting enumeration can be performed by **nmap**:

```bash
nmap -n -sV -Pn --script "*telnet* and safe" -p 23 <IP>
```

The script `telnet-ntlm-info.nse` will obtain NTLM info (Windows versions).

From the [telnet RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc854): In the TELNET Protocol are various "**options**" that will be sanctioned and may be used with the "**DO, DON'T, WILL, WON'T**" structure to allow a user and server to agree to use a more elaborate (or perhaps just different) set of conventions for their TELNET connection. Such options could include changing the character set, the echo mode, etc.

**I know it is possible to enumerate this options but I don't know how, so let me know if know how.**

### [Brute force](../generic-hacking/brute-force.md#telnet)

## Config file

```bash
/etc/inetd.conf
/etc/xinetd.d/telnet
/etc/xinetd.d/stelnet
```
