# 1723 - Pentesting PPTP

{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

**Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)** is a method widely employed for **remote access** to mobile devices. It utilizes **TCP port 1723** for the exchange of keys, while **IP protocol 47** (Generic Routing Encapsulation, or **GRE**), is used to encrypt the data that is transmitted between peers. This setup is crucial for establishing a secure communication channel over the internet, ensuring that the data exchanged remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access.

**Default Port**:1723

## Enumeration

```bash
nmap –Pn -sSV -p1723 <IP>
```
