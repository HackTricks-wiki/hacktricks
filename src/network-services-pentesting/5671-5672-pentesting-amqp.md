## Basic Information

From [cloudamqp](https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/2015-05-18-part1-rabbitmq-for-beginners-what-is-rabbitmq.html):

> **RabbitMQ** is a **message-queueing software** also known as a _message broker_ or _queue manager._ Simply said; it is software where queues are defined, to which applications connect in order to transfer a message or messages.\
> A **message can include any kind of information**. It could, for example, have information about a process or task that should start on another application (which could even be on another server), or it could be just a simple text message. The queue-manager software stores the messages until a receiving application connects and takes a message off the queue. The receiving application then processes the message.\
> Definition from .

**Default port**: 5672,5671

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
5672/tcp open  amqp    RabbitMQ 3.1.5 (0-9)
```

## Enumeration

### Manual

```python
import amqp
#By default it uses default credentials "guest":"guest"
conn = amqp.connection.Connection(host="<IP>", port=5672, virtual_host="/")
conn.connect()
for k, v in conn.server_properties.items():
    print(k, v)
```

### Automatic

```bash
nmap -sV -Pn -n -T4 -p 5672 --script amqp-info <IP>

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
5672/tcp open  amqp    RabbitMQ 3.1.5 (0-9)

## Other RabbitMQ ports

In [https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html](https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html) you can find that **rabbitmq uses several ports**:

- **1883, 8883**: ([MQTT clients](http://mqtt.org) without and with TLS, if the [MQTT plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/mqtt.html) is enabled. [**Learn more about how to pentest MQTT here**](1883-pentesting-mqtt-mosquitto.md).
- **4369: epmd**, a peer discovery service used by RabbitMQ nodes and CLI tools. [**Learn more about how to pentest this service here**](4369-pentesting-erlang-port-mapper-daemon-epmd.md).
- **5672, 5671**: used by AMQP 0-9-1 and 1.0 clients without and with TLS
- **15672**: [HTTP API](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) clients, [management UI](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) and [rabbitmqadmin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management-cli.html) (only if the [management plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) is enabled). [**Learn more about how to pentest this service here**](15672-pentesting-rabbitmq-management.md).
- 15674: STOMP-over-WebSockets clients (only if the [Web STOMP plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/web-stomp.html) is enabled)
- 15675: MQTT-over-WebSockets clients (only if the [Web MQTT plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/web-mqtt.html) is enabled)
- 15692: Prometheus metrics (only if the [Prometheus plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/prometheus.html) is enabled)
- 25672: used for inter-node and CLI tools communication (Erlang distribution server port) and is allocated from a dynamic range (limited to a single port by default, computed as AMQP port + 20000). Unless external connections on these ports are really necessary (e.g. the cluster uses [federation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/federation.html) or CLI tools are used on machines outside the subnet), these ports should not be publicly exposed. See [networking guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html) for details. **Only 9 of these ports opened on the internet**.
- 35672-35682: used by CLI tools (Erlang distribution client ports) for communication with nodes and is allocated from a dynamic range (computed as server distribution port + 10000 through server distribution port + 10010). See [networking guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html) for details.
- 61613, 61614: [STOMP clients](https://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.2.html) without and with TLS (only if the [STOMP plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/stomp.html) is enabled). Less than 10 devices with this port open and mostly UDP for DHT nodes.
