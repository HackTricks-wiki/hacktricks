# **Protocol Information**

EtherNet/IP is an **industrial Ethernet networking protocol** commonly used in **industrial automation control systems**. It was developed by Rockwell Automation in the late 1990s and is managed by ODVA. The protocol ensures **multi-vendor system interoperability** and is utilized in various applications such as **water processing plants**, **manufacturing facilities**, and **utilities**. To identify an EtherNet/IP device, a query is sent to **TCP/44818** with a **list Identities Message (0x63)**.

**Default port:** 44818 UDP/TCP

```
PORT      STATE SERVICE
44818/tcp open  EtherNet/IP
```

# **Enumeration**

```bash
nmap -n -sV --script enip-info -p 44818 <IP>
pip3 install cpppo
python3 -m cpppo.server.enip.list_services [--udp] [--broadcast] --list-identity -a <IP>
```
