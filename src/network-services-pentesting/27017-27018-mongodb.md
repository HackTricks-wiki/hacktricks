# 27017,27018 - Pentesting MongoDB

{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

**MongoDB** is an **open source** database management system that uses a **document-oriented database model** to handle diverse forms of data. It offers flexibility and scalability for managing unstructured or semi-structured data in applications like big data analytics and content management. **Default port:** 27017, 27018

```
PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION
27017/tcp open  mongodb MongoDB 2.6.9 2.6.9
```

## Enumeration

### Manual

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
client = MongoClient(host, port, username=username, password=password)
client.server_info() #Basic info
#If you have admin access you can obtain more info
admin = client.admin
admin_info = admin.command("serverStatus")
cursor = client.list_databases()
for db in cursor:
    print(db)
    print(client[db["name"]].list_collection_names())
#If admin access, you could dump the database also
```

**Some MongoDB commnads:**

```bash
show dbs
use <db>
show collections
db.<collection>.find()  #Dump the collection
db.<collection>.count() #Number of records of the collection
db.current.find({"username":"admin"})  #Find in current db the username admin
```

### Automatic

```bash
nmap -sV --script "mongo* and default" -p 27017 <IP> #By default all the nmap mongo enumerate scripts are used
```

### Shodan

- All mongodb: `"mongodb server information"`
- Search for full open mongodb servers: `"mongodb server information" -"partially enabled"`
- Only partially enable auth: `"mongodb server information" "partially enabled"`

## Login

By default mongo does not require password.\
**Admin** is a common mongo database.

```bash
mongo <HOST>
mongo <HOST>:<PORT>
mongo <HOST>:<PORT>/<DB>
mongo <database> -u <username> -p '<password>'
```

The nmap script: _**mongodb-brute**_ will check if creds are needed.

```bash
nmap -n -sV --script mongodb-brute -p 27017 <ip>
```

### [**Brute force**](../generic-hacking/brute-force.md#mongo)

Look inside _/opt/bitnami/mongodb/mongodb.conf_ to know if credentials are needed:

```bash
grep "noauth.*true" /opt/bitnami/mongodb/mongodb.conf | grep -v "^#" #Not needed
grep "auth.*true" /opt/bitnami/mongodb/mongodb.conf | grep -v "^#\|noauth" #Not needed
```

## Mongo Objectid Predict

Example [from here](https://techkranti.com/idor-through-mongodb-object-ids-prediction/).

Mongo Object IDs are **12-byte hexadecimal** strings:

![http://techidiocy.com/_id-objectid-in-mongodb/](../images/id-and-ObjectIds-in-MongoDB.png)

For example, here’s how we can dissect an actual Object ID returned by an application: 5f2459ac9fa6dc2500314019

1. 5f2459ac: 1596217772 in decimal = Friday, 31 July 2020 17:49:32
2. 9fa6dc: Machine Identifier
3. 2500: Process ID
4. 314019: An incremental counter

Of the above elements, machine identifier will remain the same for as long as the database is running the same physical/virtual machine. Process ID will only change if the MongoDB process is restarted. Timestamp will be updated every second. The only challenge in guessing Object IDs by simply incrementing the counter and timestamp values, is the fact that Mongo DB generates Object IDs and assigns Object IDs at a system level.

The tool [https://github.com/andresriancho/mongo-objectid-predict](https://github.com/andresriancho/mongo-objectid-predict), given a starting Object ID (you can create an account and get a starting ID), it sends back about 1000 probable Object IDs that could have possibly been assigned to the next objects, so you just need to bruteforce them.

## Post

If you are root you can **modify** the **mongodb.conf** file so no credentials are needed (_noauth = true_) and **login without credentials**.

## MongoBleed zlib Memory Disclosure (CVE-2025-14847)

A widespread unauthenticated memory disclosure ("MongoBleed") impacts MongoDB 3.6–8.2 when the **zlib network compressor is enabled**. The `OP_COMPRESSED` header trusts an attacker-supplied `uncompressedSize`, so the server allocates a buffer of that size and copies it back into responses even though only a much smaller compressed payload was provided. The extra bytes are **uninitialized heap data** from other connections, `/proc`, or the WiredTiger cache. Attackers then omit the expected **BSON `\x00` terminator** so MongoDB’s parser keeps scanning that oversized buffer until it finds a terminator, and the error response echoes both the malicious document and the scanned heap bytes **pre-auth** on TCP/27017.

### Exposure requirements & quick checks

- Server version must be within the vulnerable ranges (3.6, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4.0–4.4.29, 5.0.0–5.0.31, 6.0.0–6.0.26, 7.0.0–7.0.27, 8.0.0–8.0.16, 8.2.0–8.2.2).
- `net.compression.compressors` or `networkMessageCompressors` must include `zlib` (default on many builds). Check it from the shell with:

```javascript
db.adminCommand({getParameter: 1, networkMessageCompressors: 1})
```

- The attacker only needs network access to the MongoDB port. No authentication is necessary.

### Exploitation & harvesting workflow

1. Initiate the wire-protocol handshake advertising `compressors:["zlib"]` so the session uses zlib.
2. Send `OP_COMPRESSED` frames whose declared `uncompressedSize` is far larger than the real decompressed payload to force **oversized heap allocation full of old data**.
3. Craft the embedded BSON **without a final `\x00`** so the parser walks past attacker-controlled data into the oversized buffer while looking for a terminator.
4. MongoDB emits an error that includes the original message plus whatever heap bytes were scanned, leaking memory. Repeat with varying lengths/offsets to aggregate secrets (creds/API keys/session tokens), WiredTiger stats, and `/proc` artifacts.

The public PoC automates the probing offsets and carving of the returned fragments:

```bash
python3 mongobleed.py --host <target> --max-offset 50000 --output leaks.bin
```

### Detection noise signal (high-rate connections)

The attack usually generates many short-lived requests. Watch for spikes of inbound connections to `mongod`/`mongod.exe`. Example XQL hunt (>500 connections/min per remote IP, excluding RFC1918/loopback/link-local/mcast/broadcast/reserved ranges by default):
