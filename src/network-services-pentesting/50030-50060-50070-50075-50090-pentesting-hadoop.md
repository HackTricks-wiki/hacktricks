## **Basic Information**

**Apache Hadoop** is an **open-source framework** for **distributed storage and processing** of **large datasets** across **computer clusters**. It uses **HDFS** for storage and **MapReduce** for processing.

Unfortunatelly Hadoop lacks support in the Metasploit framework at the time of documentation. However, you can use the following **Nmap scripts** to enumerate Hadoop services:

- **`hadoop-jobtracker-info (Port 50030)`**
- **`hadoop-tasktracker-info (Port 50060)`**
- **`hadoop-namenode-info (Port 50070)`**
- **`hadoop-datanode-info (Port 50075)`**
- **`hadoop-secondary-namenode-info (Port 50090)`**

It's crucial to note that **Hadoop operates without authentication in its default setup**. However, for enhanced security, configurations are available to integrate Kerberos with HDFS, YARN, and MapReduce services.
