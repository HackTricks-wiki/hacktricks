# RondoDox Botnet Infection Chain

## Overview

RondoDox is a sophisticated botnet targeting TBK DVRs and Four-Faith routers by exploiting known vulnerabilities to establish persistence, disguise traffic, download additional payloads, and enable DDoS attacks.

## Exploitation Details

- Exploits CVE-2024-3721 and CVE-2024-12856 to gain initial access to devices.
- Establishes persistence on infected devices.
- Disguises malicious traffic as gaming or VPN packets to evade detection.
- Downloads additional payloads via secure connections.
- Enables infected devices to participate in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

## Impact

- Compromise of IoT and network devices.
- Use of infected devices in large-scale DDoS attacks.
- Potential data exfiltration and further network compromise.

## Mitigation

- Patch affected devices with vendor updates.
- Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns resembling gaming or VPN traffic.
- Use network security solutions to detect and block botnet communications.
