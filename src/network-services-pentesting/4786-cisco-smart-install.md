# 4786 - Cisco Smart Install

{{#include /banners/hacktricks-training.md}}




## Basic Information

**Cisco Smart Install** is a Cisco designed to automate the initial configuration and loading of an operating system image for new Cisco hardware. **By default, Cisco Smart Install is active on Cisco hardware and uses the transport layer protocol, TCP, with port number 4786.**

**Default port:** 4786

```
PORT      STATE  SERVICE
4786/tcp  open   smart-install
```

## **Smart Install Exploitation Tool**

**In 2018, a critical vulnerability, CVE-2018–0171, was found in this protocol. The threat level is 9.8 on the CVSS scale.**

**A specially crafted packet sent to the TCP/4786 port, where Cisco Smart Install is active, triggers a buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to:**

- forcibly reboot the device
- call RCE
- steal configurations of network equipment.

**The** [**SIET**](https://github.com/frostbits-security/SIET) **(Smart Install Exploitation Tool)** was developed to exploit this vulnerability, it allows you to abuse Cisco Smart Install. In this article I will show you how you can read a legitimate network hardware configuration file. Configure exfiltration can be valuable for a pentester because it will learn about the unique features of the network. And this will make life easier and allow finding new vectors for an attack.

**The target device will be a “live” Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch. Virtual images do not have Cisco Smart Install, so you can only practice on the real hardware.**

The address of the target switch is **10.10.100.10 and CSI is active.** Load SIET and start the attack. **The -g argument** means exfiltration of the configuration from the device, **the -i argument** allows you to set the IP address of the vulnerable target.

```
~/opt/tools/SIET$ sudo python2 siet.py -g -i 10.10.100.10
```

The switch configuration **10.10.100.10** will be in the **tftp/** folder
