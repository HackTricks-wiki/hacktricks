# 513 - Pentesting Rlogin

{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}


## Basic Information

In the past, **rlogin** was widely utilized for remote administration tasks. However, due to concerns regarding its security, it has largely been superseded by **slogin** and **ssh**. These newer methods provide enhanced security for remote connections.

**Default port:** 513

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE
513/tcp open  login
```

## **Login**

```bash
# Install client
apt-get install rsh-client
```

You can use the following command to try to **login** to a remote host where **no password** is required for access. Try using **root** is as username:

```bash
rlogin <IP> -l <username>
```
