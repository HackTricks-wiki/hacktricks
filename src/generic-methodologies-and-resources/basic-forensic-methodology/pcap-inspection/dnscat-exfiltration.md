# DNSCat pcap analysis

{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

If you have pcap with data being **exfiltrated by DNSCat** (without using encryption), you can find the exfiltrated content.

You only need to know that the **first 9 bytes** are not real data but are related to the **C\&C communication**:

```python
from scapy.all import rdpcap, DNSQR, DNSRR
import struct

f = ""
last = ""
for p in rdpcap('ch21.pcap'):
	if p.haslayer(DNSQR) and not p.haslayer(DNSRR):

		qry = p[DNSQR].qname.replace(".jz-n-bs.local.","").strip().split(".")
		qry = ''.join(_.decode('hex') for _ in qry)[9:]
		if last != qry:
			print(qry)
			f += qry
		last = qry

#print(f)
```

There is a script that works with Python3: [https://github.com/josemlwdf/DNScat-Decoder](https://github.com/josemlwdf/DNScat-Decoder)

```
python3 dnscat_decoder.py sample.pcap bad_domain
```
