**Audio and video file manipulation** is a staple in **CTF forensics challenges**, leveraging **steganography** and metadata analysis to hide or reveal secret messages. Tools such as **[mediainfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo)** and **`exiftool`** are essential for inspecting file metadata and identifying content types.

For audio challenges, **[Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/)** stands out as a premier tool for viewing waveforms and analyzing spectrograms, essential for uncovering text encoded in audio. **[Sonic Visualiser](http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/)** is highly recommended for detailed spectrogram analysis. **Audacity** allows for audio manipulation like slowing down or reversing tracks to detect hidden messages. **[Sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/)**, a command-line utility, excels in converting and editing audio files.

**Least Significant Bits (LSB)** manipulation is a common technique in audio and video steganography, exploiting the fixed-size chunks of media files to embed data discreetly. **[Multimon-ng](http://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/multimon-ng)** is useful for decoding messages hidden as **DTMF tones** or **Morse code**.

Video challenges often involve container formats that bundle audio and video streams. **[FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/)** is the go-to for analyzing and manipulating these formats, capable of de-multiplexing and playing back content. For developers, **[ffmpy](http://ffmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html)** integrates FFmpeg's capabilities into Python for advanced scriptable interactions.

This array of tools underscores the versatility required in CTF challenges, where participants must employ a broad spectrum of analysis and manipulation techniques to uncover hidden data within audio and video files.
