**Detailed Explanation of DHCPv6 Message Types:**

1. **Solicit (1)**: Initiated by a DHCPv6 client to find available servers.
2. **Advertise (2)**: Sent by servers in response to a Solicit, indicating availability for DHCP service.
3. **Request (3)**: Clients use this to request IP addresses or prefixes from a specific server.
4. **Confirm (4)**: Used by a client to verify if the assigned addresses are still valid on the network, typically after a network change.
5. **Renew (5)**: Clients send this to the original server to extend address lifetimes or update configurations.
6. **Rebind (6)**: Sent to any server to extend address lifetimes or update configurations, especially when no response is received to a Renew.
7. **Reply (7)**: Servers use this to provide addresses, configuration parameters, or to acknowledge messages like Release or Decline.
8. **Release (8)**: Clients inform the server to stop using one or more assigned addresses.
9. **Decline (9)**: Sent by clients to report that assigned addresses are in conflict on the network.
10. **Reconfigure (10)**: Servers prompt clients to initiate transactions for new or updated configurations.
11. **Information-Request (11)**: Clients request configuration parameters without IP address assignment.
12. **Relay-Forw (12)**: Relay agents forward messages to servers.
13. **Relay-Repl (13)**: Servers reply to relay agents, who then deliver the message to the client.
