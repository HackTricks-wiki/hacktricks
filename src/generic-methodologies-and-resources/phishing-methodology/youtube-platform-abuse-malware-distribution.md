# YouTube Platform Abuse for Malware Distribution

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

Threat actors operate coordinated, role-based networks to weaponize YouTube features for at-scale malware delivery without exploiting CVEs. The tradecraft relies on social engineering, platform feature abuse, and packaging/hosting evasion.

## Operator roles ("Ghost Network" model)
- Video-accounts: upload lures (game cheats, software cracks), seed/refresh external links in descriptions or as pinned comments, and reply to comments to build trust.
- Post-accounts: post in the Community tab with the shortlink and the archive password; rotate both periodically.
- Interact-accounts: inflate ranking/legitimacy by liking and leaving positive comments.

This separation gives resiliency: bans on one node do not halt distribution.

## Delivery patterns on YouTube
- Link placement: description, pinned comment, replies, or shown only during an “installation” segment inside the video. Often mirrored via Community posts.
- Redirect chain: shortener → Google Sites/Blogspot/Telegraph (`telegra.ph`) page revealing the password (frequently `1337`) → file-sharing host (MediaFire/Dropbox/Google Drive) → final payload.
- Social engineering: landing pages instruct the user to disable Windows Defender temporarily to prevent “false positives.”

Example text commonly seen on landing pages:

```
Turn off Windows Defender temporarily
Don't worry — the archive is clean. Defender may trigger a false alert due to the way Setup.exe works with installations.
```

## Packaging and evasion
- Password-protected archives to block engine inspection and content preview; frequent password reuse (e.g., `1337`).
- Oversized archives to bypass automatic scanning limits and “no-scan due to size” behaviours on file hosts.
- Redundant mirrors (same file hosted in multiple platforms) and frequent refresh (every 3–4 days) of links, archives, and C2s to defeat reputation and signature accumulation.
- Masquerading: archives contain a plausible cracked installer plus a staged dropper/loader.

Families observed: Lumma (historic), Rhadamanthys, StealC, RedLine, 0debug/Phemedrone variants; loaders include HijackLoader and NodeJS-based stages.

## Loader → stealer via MSI CustomAction
A common pattern is an MSI where a CustomAction launches a stage-1 EXE (e.g., `bw97v41m.exe`), which drops/renames to a loader (e.g., `Remote-Vector32.exe`, HijackLoader) and then fetches/loads the infostealer (e.g., Rhadamanthys).

Analysts can reconstruct the chain by extracting files and inspecting MSI tables with lessmsi:

```powershell
# Extract files
lessmsi x .\Set-Up.msi .\out\

# List tables of interest
lessmsi l -t CustomAction .\Set-Up.msi           # Actions, Type, Target command
lessmsi l -t InstallExecuteSequence .\Set-Up.msi  # Order of execution
lessmsi l -t File .\Set-Up.msi                    # Map file keys → filenames
lessmsi l -t Component .\Set-Up.msi               # File/component mapping
lessmsi l -t Binary .\Set-Up.msi                  # Embedded streams referenced by CustomAction
```

- Identify the CustomAction invoking an EXE or script and its `Target` (command line).
- Map the referenced file from the `File`/`Component` tables to the actual dropped path in the extracted payloads.
- Use `InstallExecuteSequence` to position when the action runs.

## Hunting and detection ideas
- Web telemetry: shorteners resolving to `sites.google.com`, `blogspot.*`, or `telegra.ph` that then redirect to file-sharing direct-download links (e.g., Dropbox `?dl=1`, MediaFire “download.php”).
- Monitor downloads of password-protected archives followed by users disabling Defender/AV services; flag pages instructing Defender disablement.
- Alert on repeated large archive downloads from new accounts/domains, especially with rapid link rotation cadence (~3–4 days).
- Egress: look for infostealer C2 patterns following an installation from consumer file hosts.

## Red-team notes (platform abuse TTPs)
- Seed and mirror links in descriptions, pinned comments, and Community posts; rotate archive and password regularly.
- Hide the password on a Google Sites/Blogspot/Telegraph page and then point to multiple file-host mirrors for resilience.
- Ship a legitimate-looking installer alongside a staged dropper/loader; use large, passworded archives to blunt automated analysis.
