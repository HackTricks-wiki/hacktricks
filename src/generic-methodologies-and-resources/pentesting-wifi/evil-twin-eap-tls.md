# Evil Twin EAP-TLS

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

EAP-TLS is the common "secure" choice for WPA2/3-Enterprise, but two practical weaknesses regularly show up during assessments:

- **Unauthenticated identity leakage**: the outer EAP-Response/Identity is sent in cleartext before any TLS tunnel is built, so real domain usernames often leak over the air.
- **Broken client server-validation**: if the supplicant doesn’t strictly verify the RADIUS server certificate (or allows users to click through warnings), a rogue AP with a self-signed cert can still onboard victims – turning mutual TLS into one-way TLS.

## Unauthenticated EAP identity leakage / username enumeration

EAP drives an identity exchange *before* TLS starts. If the client uses the real domain username as its outer identity, anyone in RF range can harvest it without authenticating.

**Passive harvest workflow**

```bash
# 1) Park on the right channel/BSSID
airodump-ng -i $IFACE -c $CHAN --bssid $BSSID

# 2) Decode EAP frames and extract identities
# Trigger a client connection (e.g., your phone) to see the leak
tshark -i "$IFACE" -Y eap -V | grep "Identity: *[a-z]\|*[A-Z]\|*[0-9]"
```

Impact: fast, no-auth username collection → fuels password spraying, phishing, account correlation. Worse when usernames match email addresses.

## TLS 1.3 privacy vs downgrade games

TLS 1.3 encrypts client certs and most handshake metadata, so when a supplicant *actually* negotiates TLS 1.3, an Evil Twin cannot passively learn the client certificate/identity. Many enterprise stacks still allow TLS 1.2 for compatibility; RFC 9190 warns that a rogue AP can offer only TLS 1.2 static-RSA suites to force a fallback and re-expose the outer identity (or even the client cert) in cleartext EAP-TLS.

**Offensive playbook (downgrade to leak ID):**
- Compile hostapd-wpe with only TLS 1.2 static RSA ciphers enabled and TLS 1.3 disabled in `openssl_ciphersuite` / `ssl_ctx_flags`.
- Advertise the corporate SSID; when the victim initiates TLS 1.3, respond with a TLS alert and restart the handshake so the peer retries with TLS 1.2, revealing its real identity before cert validation succeeds.
- Pair this with `force_authorized=1` in hostapd-wpe so the 4-way handshake completes even if client-auth fails, giving you DHCP/DNS-level traffic to phish or portal.

**Defensive toggle (what to look for during an assessment):**
- hostapd/wpa_supplicant 2.10 added EAP-TLS server *and* peer support for TLS 1.3 but ships it **disabled by default**; enabling it on clients with `phase1="tls_disable_tlsv1_3=0"` removes the downgrade window.

## Evil Twin via broken server validation ("mTLS?")

Rogue APs broadcasting the corporate SSID can present any certificate. If the client:
- **doesn’t validate** the server cert, or
- **prompts the user** and allows override of untrusted CAs/self-signed certs,
then EAP-TLS stops being mutual. A modified **hostapd/hostapd-wpe** that skips client-cert validation (e.g., `SSL_set_verify(..., 0)`) is enough to stand up the Evil Twin.

### Rogue infra quick note

On recent Kali, compile `hostapd-wpe` using hostapd-2.6 (from https://w1.fi/releases/) and install the legacy OpenSSL headers first:

```bash
apt-get install libssl1.0-dev
# patch hostapd-wpe to set verify_peer=0 in SSL_set_verify to accept any client cert
```

### Windows supplicant misconfig pitfalls (GUI/GPO)

Key knobs from the Windows EAP-TLS profile:
- **Verify the server's identity by validating the certificate**
  - Checked → chain must be trusted; unchecked → any self-signed cert is accepted.
- **Connect to these servers**
  - Empty → any cert from a trusted CA is accepted; set CN/SAN list to pin expected RADIUS names.
- **Don't prompt user to authorise new servers or trusted certification authorities**
  - Checked → users cannot click through; unchecked → user can trust an untrusted CA/cert and join the rogue AP.

Observed outcomes:
- **Strict validation + no prompts** → rogue cert rejected; Windows logs an event and TLS fails (good detection signal).
- **Validation + user prompt** → user acceptance = successful Evil Twin association.
- **No validation** → silent Evil Twin association with any cert.
