# Evil Twin EAP-TLS

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

EAP-TLS is the common "secure" choice for WPA2/3-Enterprise, but two practical weaknesses regularly show up during assessments:

- **Unauthenticated identity leakage**: the outer EAP-Response/Identity is sent in cleartext before any TLS tunnel is built, so real domain usernames often leak over the air.
- **Broken client server-validation**: if the supplicant doesn’t strictly verify the RADIUS server certificate (or allows users to click through warnings), a rogue AP with a self-signed cert can still onboard victims – turning mutual TLS into one-way TLS.

## Unauthenticated EAP identity leakage / username enumeration

EAP drives an identity exchange *before* TLS starts. If the client uses the real domain username as its outer identity, anyone in RF range can harvest it without authenticating.

**Passive harvest workflow**

```bash
# 1) Park on the right channel/BSSID
airodump-ng -i $IFACE -c $CHAN --bssid $BSSID

# 2) Decode EAP frames and extract identities
# Trigger a client connection (e.g., your phone) to see the leak
tshark -i "$IFACE" -Y eap -V | grep "Identity: *[a-z]\|*[A-Z]\|*[0-9]"
```

Impact: fast, no-auth username collection → fuels password spraying, phishing, account correlation. Worse when usernames match email addresses.

## Evil Twin via broken server validation ("mTLS?")

Rogue APs broadcasting the corporate SSID can present any certificate. If the client:
- **doesn’t validate** the server cert, or
- **prompts the user** and allows override of untrusted CAs/self-signed certs,
then EAP-TLS stops being mutual. A modified **hostapd/hostapd-wpe** that skips client-cert validation (e.g., `SSL_set_verify(..., 0)`) is enough to stand up the Evil Twin.

### Rogue infra quick note

On recent Kali, compile `hostapd-wpe` using hostapd-2.6 (from https://w1.fi/releases/) and install the legacy OpenSSL headers first:

```bash
apt-get install libssl1.0-dev
# patch hostapd-wpe to set verify_peer=0 in SSL_set_verify to accept any client cert
```

### Windows supplicant misconfig pitfalls (GUI/GPO)

Key knobs from the Windows EAP-TLS profile:
- **Verify the server's identity by validating the certificate**
  - Checked → chain must be trusted; unchecked → any self-signed cert is accepted.
- **Connect to these servers**
  - Empty → any cert from a trusted CA is accepted; set CN/SAN list to pin expected RADIUS names.
- **Don't prompt user to authorise new servers or trusted certification authorities**
  - Checked → users cannot click through; unchecked → user can trust an untrusted CA/cert and join the rogue AP.

Observed outcomes:
- **Strict validation + no prompts** → rogue cert rejected; Windows logs an event and TLS fails (good detection signal).
- **Validation + user prompt** → user acceptance = successful Evil Twin association.
- **No validation** → silent Evil Twin association with any cert.
