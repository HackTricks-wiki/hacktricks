# Enable NexMon Monitor Mode & Packet Injection on Android (Broadcom chips)

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Overview
Most modern Android phones embed a Broadcom/Cypress Wi-Fi chipset that ships without 802.11 monitor mode or frame-injection capabilities.  The open-source NexMon framework patches the proprietary firmware to add those features and exposes them through a shared library (`libnexmon.so`) and a CLI helper (`nexutil`).  By pre-loading that library into the stock Wi-Fi driver, a rooted device can capture raw 802.11 traffic and inject arbitrary frames – eliminating the need for an external USB adapter.

This page documents a fast workflow that takes a fully-patched Samsung Galaxy S10 (BCM4375B1) as an example, using:

* NexMon Magisk module containing the patched firmware + `libnexmon.so`
* Hijacker Android application to automate monitor-mode toggling
* Optional Kali NetHunter chroot to run classic wireless tools (aircrack-ng, wifite, mdk4 …) directly against the internal interface

The same technique applies to any handset that has a publicly available NexMon patch (Pixel 1, Nexus 6P, Galaxy S7/S8, etc.).

---

## Prerequisites
* Android handset with a supported Broadcom/Cypress chipset (e.g. BCM4358/59/43596/4375B1)
* Root with Magisk ≥ 24
* BusyBox (most ROMs/NetHunter already include it)
* NexMon Magisk ZIP or self-compiled patch providing:
  * `/system/lib*/libnexmon.so`
  * `/system/xbin/nexutil`
* Hijacker ≥ 1.7 (arm/arm64) – https://github.com/chrisk44/Hijacker
* (Optional) Kali NetHunter or any Linux chroot where you intend to run wireless tools

---

## Flashing the NexMon patch (Magisk)
1. Download the ZIP for your exact device/firmware (example: `nexmon-s10.zip`).
2. Open Magisk -> Modules -> Install from storage -> select the ZIP and reboot.
   The module copies `libnexmon.so` into `/data/adb/modules/<module>/lib*/` and ensures SELinux labels are correct.
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   ls -lZ $(find / -name libnexmon.so 2>/dev/null)
   sha1sum $(which nexutil)
   ```

## Configuring Hijacker
Hijacker can toggle monitor mode automatically before running `airodump`, `wifite`, etc.  In **Settings -> Advanced** add the following entries (edit the library path if your module differs):

```
Prefix:
LD_PRELOAD=/data/user/0/com.hijacker/files/lib/libnexmon.so

Enable monitor mode:
svc wifi disable; ifconfig wlan0 up; nexutil -s0x613 -i -v2

Disable monitor mode:
nexutil -m0; svc wifi enable
```

Enable “Start monitor mode on airodump start” so every Hijacker scan happens in native monitor mode (`wlan0` instead of `wlan0mon`).

If Hijacker shows errors at launch, create the required directory on shared storage and reopen the app:
```bash
mkdir -p /storage/emulated/0/Hijacker
```

### What do those `nexutil` flags mean?
* **`-s0x613`**   Write firmware variable 0x613 (FCAP_FRAME_INJECTION) → `1` (enable TX of arbitrary frames).
* **`-i`**         Put interface in monitor mode (radiotap header will be prepended).
* **`-v2`**        Set verbose level; `2` prints confirmation and firmware version.
* **`-m0`**        Restore managed mode (used in the *disable* command).

After running *Enable monitor mode* you should see the interface in monitor state and be able to capture raw frames with:
```bash
airodump-ng --band abg wlan0
```

---

## Manual one-liner (without Hijacker)
```bash
# Enable monitor + injection
svc wifi disable && ifconfig wlan0 up && nexutil -s0x613 -i -v2

# Disable and return to normal Wi-Fi
nexutil -m0 && svc wifi enable
```

If you only need passive sniffing, omit the `-s0x613` flag.

## Using `libnexmon` inside Kali NetHunter / chroot
Stock user-space tools in Kali do not know about NexMon, but you can force them to use it via `LD_PRELOAD`:

1. Copy the pre-built shared object into the chroot:
   ```bash
   cp /sdcard/Download/kalilibnexmon.so <chroot>/lib/
   ```
2. Enable monitor mode from the **Android host** (command above or through Hijacker).
3. Launch any wireless tool inside Kali with the preload:
   ```bash
   sudo su
   export LD_PRELOAD=/lib/kalilibnexmon.so
   wifite -i wlan0        # or aircrack-ng, mdk4 …
   ```
4. When finished, disable monitor mode as usual on Android.

Because the firmware already handles radiotap injection, user-space tools behave just like on an external Atheros adapter.

## Typical Attacks Possible
Once monitor + TX is active you can:
* Capture WPA(2/3-SAE) handshakes or PMKID with `wifite`, `hcxdumptool`, `airodump-ng`.
* Inject deauthentication / disassociation frames to force clients to reconnect.
* Craft arbitrary management/data frames with `mdk4`, `aireplay-ng`, Scapy, etc.
* Build rogue APs or perform KARMA/MANA attacks directly from the phone.

Performance on the Galaxy S10 is comparable to external USB NICs (~20 dBm TX, 2-3 M pps RX).

---

## Troubleshooting
* `Device or resource busy` – make sure **Android Wi-Fi service is disabled** (`svc wifi disable`) before enabling monitor mode.
* `nexutil: ioctl(PRIV_MAGIC) failed` – the library is not pre-loaded; double-check `LD_PRELOAD` path.
* Frame injection works but no packets captured – some ROMs hard-block channels; try `nexutil -c <channel>` or `iwconfig wlan0 channel <n>`.
* SELinux blocking library – set device to *Permissive* or fix module context: `chcon u:object_r:system_lib_file:s0 libnexmon.so`.
