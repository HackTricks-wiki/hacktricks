**This is a summary of the post: [https://portswigger.net/research/http-3-connection-contamination](https://portswigger.net/research/http-3-connection-contamination)**. Check it for further details!

Web browsers can reuse a single HTTP/2+ connection for different websites through [HTTP connection coalescing](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/08/18/http2-connection-coalescing), given shared IP addresses and a common TLS certificate. However, this can conflict with **first-request routing** in reverse-proxies, where subsequent requests are directed to the back-end determined by the first request. This misrouting can lead to security vulnerabilities, particularly when combined with wildcard TLS certificates and domains like `*.example.com`.

For example, if `wordpress.example.com` and `secure.example.com` are both served by the same reverse proxy and have a common wildcard certificate, a browser's connection coalescing could lead requests to `secure.example.com` to be wrongly processed by the WordPress back-end, exploiting vulnerabilities such as XSS.

To observe connection coalescing, Chrome's Network tab or tools like Wireshark can be used. Here's a snippet for testing:

```javascript
fetch("//sub1.hackxor.net/", { mode: "no-cors", credentials: "include" }).then(
  () => {
    fetch("//sub2.hackxor.net/", { mode: "no-cors", credentials: "include" })
  }
)
```

The threat is currently limited due to the rarity of first-request routing and the complexity of HTTP/2. However, the proposed changes in HTTP/3, which relax the IP address match requirement, could broaden the attack surface, making servers with a wildcard certificate more vulnerable without needing a MITM attack.

Best practices include avoiding first-request routing in reverse proxies and being cautious with wildcard TLS certificates, especially with the advent of HTTP/3. Regular testing and awareness of these complex, interconnected vulnerabilities are crucial for maintaining web security.
