# Cookie Bomb

**`Cookie bomb`** involves **adding a significant number of large cookies to a domain and its subdomains targeting a user**. This action results in the victim **sending oversized HTTP requests** to the server, which are subsequently **rejected by the server**. The consequence of this is the induction of a Denial of Service (DoS) specifically targeted at a user within that domain and its subdomains.

A nice **example** can be seen in this write-up: [https://hackerone.com/reports/57356](https://hackerone.com/reports/57356)
