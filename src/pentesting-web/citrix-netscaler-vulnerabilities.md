# Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway Vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-5349, CVE-2025-5777)

## Overview

Two critical vulnerabilities affect Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway:

- **CVE-2025-5349:** Improper access control in the management interface allowing unauthorized access.
- **CVE-2025-5777:** Memory over-read vulnerability caused by insufficient input validation when configured as a Gateway, potentially exposing sensitive data.

## Vulnerability Details

| CVE           | Type                  | Impact                          | Authentication | Description                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| CVE-2025-5349 | Improper Access Control| Unauthorized access to management interface | None           | Allows attackers to access management interface without proper authorization. |
| CVE-2025-5777 | Memory Over-read      | Exposure of sensitive data     | None           | Insufficient input validation leads to memory over-read and data leakage. |

## Exploitation

- CVE-2025-5349 allows attackers to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to the management interface.
- CVE-2025-5777 can be triggered by sending crafted requests to the Gateway, causing memory over-read and potential data leakage.

## Mitigation

- Apply the latest patches provided by Citrix immediately.
- Restrict access to management interfaces.
- Use IPS/IDS solutions with signatures to detect and block exploitation attempts.
