## **PHP File uploads**

When a **PHP** engine receives a **POST request** containing files formatted according to RFC 1867, it generates temporary files to store the uploaded data. These files are crucial for file upload handling in PHP scripts. The `move_uploaded_file` function must be used to relocate these temporary files to a desired location if persistent storage beyond the script's execution is needed. Post-execution, PHP automatically deletes any remaining temporary files.

> [!TIP]
> **Security Alert: Attackers, aware of the temporary files' location, might exploit a Local File Inclusion vulnerability to execute code by accessing the file during upload.**

The challenge for unauthorized access lies in predicting the temporary file's name, which is intentionally randomized.

### Exploitation on Windows Systems

On Windows, PHP generates temporary file names using the `GetTempFileName` function, resulting in a pattern like `<path>\<pre><uuuu>.TMP`. Notably:

- The default path is typically `C:\Windows\Temp`.
- The prefix is usually "php".
- The `<uuuu>` represents a unique hexadecimal value. Crucially, due to the function's limitation, only the lower 16 bits are used, allowing for a maximum of 65,535 unique names with constant path and prefix, making brute force feasible.

Moreover, the exploitation process is simplified on Windows systems. A peculiarity in the `FindFirstFile` function permits the use of wildcards in Local File Inclusion (LFI) paths. This enables crafting an include path like the following to locate the temporary file:

```
http://site/vuln.php?inc=c:\windows\temp\php<<
```

In certain situations, a more specific mask (like `php1<<` or `phpA<<`) might be required. One can systematically try these masks to discover the uploaded temporary file.

### Exploitation on GNU/Linux Systems

For GNU/Linux systems, the randomness in temporary file naming is robust, rendering the names neither predictable nor susceptible to brute force attacks. Further details can be found in the referenced documentation.
