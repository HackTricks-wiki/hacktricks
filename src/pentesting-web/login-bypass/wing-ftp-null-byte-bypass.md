# Wing FTP Server Null-Byte Injection Authentication Bypass and Remote Code Execution (CVE-2025-47812)

## Overview

A critical remote code execution vulnerability exists in Wing FTP Server due to a null-byte injection in the username field that bypasses authentication.

## Vulnerability Details

- **CVE:** CVE-2025-47812
- **Type:** Authentication Bypass, Remote Code Execution
- **Authentication:** Bypass via null-byte injection
- **Impact:** Attackers can log in without valid credentials and execute arbitrary commands on the server.

## Exploitation

By injecting a null byte (`%00`) in the username field, attackers bypass authentication checks. The server treats the username as valid and grants authenticated user privileges via the UID cookie.

Example payload:

```
username=admin%00
password=any
```

Once authenticated, attackers can execute arbitrary commands remotely.

## Mitigation

- Update Wing FTP Server to the latest patched version.
- Use IPS/IDS signatures to detect and block exploitation attempts.
- Monitor authentication logs for suspicious login attempts with null bytes.
