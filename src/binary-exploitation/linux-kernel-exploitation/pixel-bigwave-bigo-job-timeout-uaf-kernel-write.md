# Pixel BigWave BIGO timeout race UAF → 2KB kernel write from mediacodec

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## TL;DR

- From the SELinux-confined **mediacodec** context, `/dev/bigwave` (Pixel AV1 hardware accelerator) is reachable. A backlog of jobs makes `BIGO_IOCX_PROCESS` hit its **16s wait_for_completion_timeout()** and return while the worker thread concurrently dequeues the same inline `job` structure.
- Closing the FD immediately frees `struct bigo_inst` (which embeds `struct bigo_job`). The worker reconstructs `inst = container_of(job, ...)` and later uses freed fields such as **`job->regs`** inside `bigo_run_job()`, yielding a **Use-After-Free on the inline job/inst**.
- `bigo_pull_regs(core, job->regs)` performs `memcpy_fromio(regs, core->base, core->regs_size)`. By reclaiming the freed slab and overwriting `job->regs`, an attacker gets a **~2144-byte arbitrary kernel write** to a chosen address, with partial control of the bytes by pre-programming register values before the timeout.
- Tracked as **CVE-2025-36934**; fixed in the **2026-01-05 Pixel/2025-12-01 ASB** builds.

## Attack surface mapping (SELinux → /dev reachability)

- Use tools like **DriverCartographer** to enumerate device nodes accessible from a given SELinux domain. Despite mediacodec’s constrained policy (software decoders should stay in an isolated context), `/dev/bigwave` remained reachable, exposing a large attack surface to post-media-RCE code.

## Vulnerability: BIGO_IOCX_PROCESS timeout vs worker

- Flow: ioctl copies user register buffer into `job->regs`, queues the inline `job`, then `wait_for_completion_timeout(..., 16s)` is called. On timeout it tries to dequeue/cancel and returns to userspace.
- Meanwhile `bigo_worker_thread` may have just dequeued the same `job`:

```c
inst = container_of(job, struct bigo_inst, job);
bigo_push_regs(core, job->regs);
...
bigo_pull_regs(core, job->regs);   // memcpy_fromio(regs, core->base, core->regs_size)
*(u32 *)(job->regs + BIGO_REG_STAT) = status;
```

- If userspace closes the FD after the timeout, `inst`/`job` are freed while the worker keeps using them → UAF. No synchronization ties FD lifetime to the worker thread’s job pointer.

## Exploitation outline

1. **Backlog + timeout:** Queue enough jobs so the worker is delayed, then issue `BIGO_IOCX_PROCESS` and let it hit the 16s timeout path.
2. **Free while in use:** As soon as ioctl returns, `close(fd)` to free `inst`/`job` while the worker is still running the dequeued job.
3. **Reclaim + pointer control:** Spray reclaimers (e.g., **Unix domain socket message** allocations) to occupy the freed slab slot and overwrite the inline `job`, especially `job->regs`.
4. **Arbitrary write:** When `bigo_pull_regs()` runs, `memcpy_fromio()` writes **core->regs_size (~2144 bytes)** from MMIO into the attacker-supplied address in `job->regs`, producing a large write-what-where without a KASLR leak.
5. **Data shaping:** Because registers are first programmed from user data (`bigo_push_regs`), set them so the hardware does not execute, keeping the copied-back register image close to attacker-controlled bytes.

### Minimal PoC skeleton (blocking backlog + reclaim)

```c
int fd = open("/dev/bigwave", O_RDWR);
for (int i = 0; i < 64; i++) submit_job(fd, regs_buf);   // fill worker queue
submit_job(fd, regs_buf);                                // victim job
auto t0 = now();
while (now() - t0 < 17000ms) sched_yield();              // hit 16s timeout
close(fd);                                               // free inst/job
spray_uds_msgs(payload_pointing_to_target, spray_count); // reclaim slab
sleep(1);                                                // let worker memcpy_fromio
```

- `regs_buf` should preconfigure BigWave to idle (e.g., set control bits to skip execution) so the copied-back register image stays deterministic.

## Takeaways for driver reviewers

- Inline per-FD job structs enqueued to async workers must hold references that survive timeout/cancel paths; **closing an FD must synchronize with worker consumption**.
- Any MMIO copy helpers (`memcpy_fromio`/`memcpy_toio`) that use buffer pointers from jobs should be validated or duplicated before enqueuing to avoid UAF→write primitives.
