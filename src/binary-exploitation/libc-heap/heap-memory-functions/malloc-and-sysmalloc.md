## Allocation Order Summary <a href="#libc_malloc" id="libc_malloc"></a>

(No checks are explained in this summary and some case have been omitted for brevity)

1. `__libc_malloc` tries to get a chunk from the tcache, if not it calls `_int_malloc`
2. `_int_malloc` :
   1. Tries to generate the arena if there isn't any
   2. If any fast bin chunk of the correct size, use it
      1. Fill tcache with other fast chunks
   3. If any small bin chunk of the correct size, use it
      1. Fill tcache with other chunks of that size
   4. If the requested size isn't for small bins, consolidate fast bin into unsorted bin
   5. Check the unsorted bin, use the first chunk with enough space
      1. If the found chunk is bigger, divide it to return a part and add the reminder back to the unsorted bin
      2. If a chunk is of the same size as the size requested, use to to fill the tcache instead of returning it (until the tcache is full, then return the next one)
      3. For each chunk of smaller size checked, put it in its respective small or large bin
   6. Check the large bin in the index of the requested size
      1. Start looking from the first chunk that is bigger than the requested size, if any is found return it and add the reminders to the small bin
   7. Check the large bins from the next indexes until the end
      1. From the next bigger index check for any chunk, divide the first found chunk to use it for the requested size and add the reminder to the unsorted bin
   8. If nothing is found in the previous bins, get a chunk from the top chunk
   9. If the top chunk wasn't big enough enlarge it with `sysmalloc`

## \_\_libc_malloc <a href="#libc_malloc" id="libc_malloc"></a>

The `malloc` function actually calls `__libc_malloc`. This function will check the tcache to see if there is any available chunk of the desired size. If the re is it'll use it and if not it'll check if it's a single thread and in that case it'll call `_int_malloc` in the main arena, and if not it'll call `_int_malloc` in arena of the thread.

```c
 void *tag_new_usable (void *ptr)

   Allocate a new random color and use it to color the user region of
   a chunk; this may include data from the subsequent chunk's header
   if tagging is sufficiently fine grained.  Returns PTR suitably
   recolored for accessing the memory there.

## \_int_malloc <a href="#int_malloc" id="int_malloc"></a>

This is the function that allocates memory using the other bins and top chunk.

It starts defining some vars and getting the real size the request memory space need to have:

In the unlikely event that there aren't usable arenas, it uses `sysmalloc` to get a chunk from `mmap`:

      if (p != NULL)
	alloc_perturb (p, bytes);
      return p;
    }
```

</details>

### Fast Bin

If the needed size is inside the Fast Bins sizes, try to use a chunk from the fast bin. Basically, based on the size, it'll find the fast bin index where valid chunks should be located, and if any, it'll return one of those.\
Moreover, if tcache is enabled, it'll **fill the tcache bin of that size with fast bins**.

While performing these actions, some security checks are executed in here:

- If the chunk is misaligned: `malloc(): unaligned fastbin chunk detected 2`
- If the forward chunk is misaligned: `malloc(): unaligned fastbin chunk detected`
- If the returned chunk has a size that isn't correct because of it's index in the fast bin: `malloc(): memory corruption (fast)`
- If any chunk used to fill the tcache is misaligned: `malloc(): unaligned fastbin chunk detected 3`

### Small Bin

As indicated in a comment, small bins hold one size per index, therefore checking if a valid chunk is available is super fast, so after fast bins, small bins are checked.

The first check is to find out if the requested size could be inside a small bin. In that case, get the corresponded **index** inside the smallbin and see if there is **any available chunk**.

Then, a security check is performed checking:

- if `victim->bk->fd = victim`. To see that both chunks are correctly linked.

In that case, the chunk **gets the `inuse` bit,** the doubled linked list is fixed so this chunk disappears from it (as it's going to be used), and the non main arena bit is set if needed.

Finally, **fill the tcache index of the requested size** with other chunks inside the small bin (if any).

### malloc_consolidate

If it wasn't a small chunk, it's a large chunk, and in this case **`malloc_consolidate`** is called to avoid memory fragmentation.

<details>

<summary>malloc_consolidate call</summary>

```c
/*
     If this is a large request, consolidate fastbins before continuing.
     While it might look excessive to kill all fastbins before
     even seeing if there is space available, this avoids
     fragmentation problems normally associated with fastbins.
     Also, in practice, programs tend to have runs of either small or
     large requests, but less often mixtures, so consolidation is not
     invoked all that often in most programs. And the programs that
     it is called frequently in otherwise tend to fragment.
   */

  else
    {
      idx = largebin_index (nb);
      if (atomic_load_relaxed (&av->have_fastchunks))
        malloc_consolidate (av);
    }

```

</details>

The malloc consolidate function basically removes chunks from the fast bin and places them into the unsorted bin. After the next malloc these chunks will be organized in their respective small/fast bins.

Note that if while removing these chunks, if they are found with previous or next chunks that aren't in use they will be **unliked and merged** before placing the final chunk in the **unsorted** bin.

For each fast bin chunk a couple of security checks are performed:

- If the chunk is unaligned trigger: `malloc_consolidate(): unaligned fastbin chunk detected`
- If the chunk has a different size that the one it should because of the index it's in: `malloc_consolidate(): invalid chunk size`
- If the previous chunk is not in use and the previous chunk has a size different of the one indicated by `prev_chunk`: `corrupted size vs. prev_size in fastbins`

### Unsorted bin

It's time to check the unsorted bin for a potential valid chunk to use.

#### Start

This starts with a big for look that will be traversing the unsorted bin in the `bk` direction until it arrives til the end (the arena struct) with `while ((victim = unsorted_chunks (av)->bk) != unsorted_chunks (av))`

Moreover, some security checks are perform every time a new chunk is considered:

- If the chunk size is weird (too small or too big): `malloc(): invalid size (unsorted)`
- If the next chunk size is weird (too small or too big): `malloc(): invalid next size (unsorted)`
- If the previous size indicated by the next chunk differs from the size of the chunk: `malloc(): mismatching next->prev_size (unsorted)`
- If not `victim->bck->fd == victim` or not `victim->fd == av` (arena): `malloc(): unsorted double linked list corrupted`
  - As we are always checking the las one, it's `fd` should be pointing always to the arena struct.
- If the next chunk isn't indicating that the previous is in use: `malloc(): invalid next->prev_inuse (unsorted)`

     bins.  Note that this step is the only place in any routine where
     chunks are placed in bins.

     The outer loop here is needed because we might not realize until
     near the end of malloc that we should have consolidated, so must
     do so and retry. This happens at most once, and only when we would
     otherwise need to expand memory to service a "small" request.

If the reminder space from the finally used chunk can be a new chunk, add it to the unsorted bin and the lsast_reminder is updated.

A security check is made when adding the reminder to the unsorted bin:

### Top Chunk

At this point, it's time to get a new chunk from the Top chunk (if big enough).

It starts with a security check making sure that the size of the chunk size is not too big (corrupted):

- `chunksize(av->top) > av->system_mem`: `malloc(): corrupted top size`

Then, it'll use the top chunk space if it's large enough to create a chunk of the requested size.\
If not, if there are fast chunks, consolidate them and try again.\
Finally, if not enough space use `sysmalloc` to allocate enough size.

<details>

<summary><code>_int_malloc</code> Top chunk</summary>

```c
use_top:
      /*
         If large enough, split off the chunk bordering the end of memory
         (held in av->top). Note that this is in accord with the best-fit
         search rule.  In effect, av->top is treated as larger (and thus
         less well fitting) than any other available chunk since it can
         be extended to be as large as necessary (up to system
         limitations).

         We require that av->top always exists (i.e., has size >=
         MINSIZE) after initialization, so if it would otherwise be
         exhausted by current request, it is replenished. (The main
         reason for ensuring it exists is that we may need MINSIZE space
         to put in fenceposts in sysmalloc.)

### sysmalloc checks

It starts by getting old top chunk information and checking that some of the following condations are true:

- The old heap size is 0 (new heap)
- The size of the previous heap is greater and MINSIZE and the old Top is in use
- The heap is aligned to page size (0x1000 so the lower 12 bits need to be 0)

Then it also checks that:

- The old size hasn't enough space to create a chunk for the requested size

<details>

<summary>sysmalloc checks</summary>

```c
/* Record incoming configuration of top */

  old_top = av->top;
  old_size = chunksize (old_top);
  old_end = (char *) (chunk_at_offset (old_top, old_size));

  brk = snd_brk = (char *) (MORECORE_FAILURE);

  /*
     If not the first time through, we require old_size to be
     at least MINSIZE and to have prev_inuse set.
   */
