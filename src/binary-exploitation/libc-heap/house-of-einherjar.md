## Basic Information

### Code

- Check the example from [https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.35/house_of_einherjar.c](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.35/house_of_einherjar.c)
- Or the one from [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/42-house_of_einherjar/house_einherjar_exp/index.html#house-of-einherjar-explanation](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/42-house_of_einherjar/house_einherjar_exp/index.html#house-of-einherjar-explanation) (you might need to fill the tcache)

### Goal

- The goal is to allocate memory in almost any specific address.

### Requirements

- Create a fake chunk when we want to allocate a chunk:
  - Set pointers to point to itself to bypass sanity checks
- One-byte overflow with a null byte from one chunk to the next one to modify the `PREV_INUSE` flag.
- Indicate in the `prev_size` of the off-by-null abused chunk the difference between itself and the fake chunk
  - The fake chunk size must also have been set the same size to bypass sanity checks
- For constructing these chunks, you will need a heap leak.

### Attack

- `A` fake chunk is created inside a chunk controlled by the attacker pointing with `fd` and `bk` to the original chunk to bypass protections
- 2 other chunks (`B` and `C`) are allocated
- Abusing the off by one in the `B` one the `prev in use` bit is cleaned and the `prev_size` data is overwritten with the difference between the place where the `C` chunk is allocated, to the fake `A` chunk generated before
  - This `prev_size` and the size in the fake chunk `A` must be the same to bypass checks.
- Then, the tcache is filled
- Then, `C` is freed so it consolidates with the fake chunk `A`
- Then, a new chunk `D` is created which will be starting in the fake `A` chunk and covering `B` chunk
  - The house of Einherjar finishes here
- This can be continued with a fast bin attack or Tcache poisoning:
  - Free `B` to add it to the fast bin / Tcache
  - `B`'s `fd` is overwritten making it point to the target address abusing the `D` chunk (as it contains `B` inside)
  - Then, 2 mallocs are done and the second one is going to be **allocating the target address**

  - After freeing pointers their aren't nullified, so it's still possible to access their data. Therefore a chunk is placed in the unsorted bin and leaked the pointers it contains (libc leak) and then a new heap is places on the unsorted bin and leaked a heap address from the pointer it gets.

  - Null-byte overflow bug in `strtok`.
  - Use House of Einherjar to get an overlapping chunks situation and finish with Tcache poisoning ti get an arbitrary write primitive.
