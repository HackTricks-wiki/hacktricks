## iOS Exploit Mitigations

- **Code Signing** in iOS works by requiring every piece of executable code (apps, libraries, extensions, etc.) to be cryptographically signed with a certificate issued by Apple. When code is loaded, iOS verifies the digital signature against Apple’s trusted root. If the signature is invalid, missing, or modified, the OS refuses to run it. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious code into legitimate apps or running unsigned binaries, effectively stopping most exploit chains that rely on executing arbitrary or tampered code.
    - **CoreTrust** is the iOS subsystem responsible for enforcing code signing at runtime. It directly verifies signatures using Apple’s root certificate without relying on cached trust stores, meaning only binaries signed by Apple (or with valid entitlements) can execute. CoreTrust ensures that even if an attacker tampers with an app after installation, modifies system libraries, or tries to load unsigned code, the system will block execution unless the code is still properly signed. This strict enforcement closes many post-exploitation vectors that older iOS versions allowed through weaker or bypassable signature checks.
- **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)** marks memory regions as non-executable unless they explicitly contain code. This stops attackers from injecting shellcode into data regions (like the stack or heap) and running it, forcing them to rely on more complex techniques like ROP (Return-Oriented Programming).
- **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)** randomizes the memory addresses of code, libraries, stack, and heap every time the system runs. This makes it much harder for attackers to predict where useful instructions or gadgets are, breaking many exploit chains that depend on fixed memory layouts.
- **KASLR (Kernel ASLR)** applies the same randomization concept to the iOS kernel. By shuffling the kernel’s base address at each boot, it prevents attackers from reliably locating kernel functions or structures, raising the difficulty of kernel-level exploits that would otherwise gain full system control.
- **Kernel Patch Protection (KPP)** also known as **AMCC (Apple Mobile File Integrity)** in iOS, continuously monitors the kernel’s code pages to ensure they haven’t been modified. If any tampering is detected—such as an exploit trying to patch kernel functions or insert malicious code—the device will immediately panic and reboot. This protection makes persistent kernel exploits far harder, as attackers can’t simply hook or patch kernel instructions without triggering a system crash.
- **Kernel Text Readonly Region (KTRR)** is a hardware-based security feature introduced on iOS devices. It uses the CPU’s memory controller to mark the kernel’s code (text) section as permanently read-only after boot. Once locked, even the kernel itself cannot modify this memory region. This prevents attackers—and even privileged code—from patching kernel instructions at runtime, closing off a major class of exploits that relied on modifying kernel code directly.
- **Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC)** use cryptographic signatures embedded into unused bits of pointers to verify their integrity before use. When a pointer (like a return address or function pointer) is created, the CPU signs it with a secret key; before dereferencing, the CPU checks the signature. If the pointer was tampered with, the check fails and execution stops. This prevents attackers from forging or reusing corrupted pointers in memory corruption exploits, making techniques like ROP or JOP much harder to pull off reliably.
- **Privilege Access never (PAN)** is a hardware feature that prevents the kernel (privileged mode) from directly accessing user-space memory unless it explicitly enables access. This stops attackers who gained kernel code execution from easily reading or writing user memory to escalate exploits or steal sensitive data. By enforcing strict separation, PAN reduces the impact of kernel exploits and blocks many common privilege-escalation techniques.
- **Page Protection Layer (PPL)** is an iOS security mechanism that protects critical kernel-managed memory regions, especially those related to code signing and entitlements. It enforces strict write protections using the MMU (Memory Management Unit) and additional checks, ensuring that even privileged kernel code cannot arbitrarily modify sensitive pages. This prevents attackers who gain kernel-level execution from tampering with security-critical structures, making persistence and code-signing bypasses significantly harder.

## Old Kernel Heap (Pre-iOS 15 / Pre-A12 era)

The kernel used a **zone allocator** (`kalloc`) divided into fixed-size "zones."  
Each zone only stores allocations of a single size class.

From the screenshot:

| Zone Name            | Element Size | Example Use                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `default.kalloc.16`  | 16 bytes     | Very small kernel structs, pointers.                                        |
| `default.kalloc.32`  | 32 bytes     | Small structs, object headers.                                              |
| `default.kalloc.64`  | 64 bytes     | IPC messages, tiny kernel buffers.                                          |
| `default.kalloc.128` | 128 bytes    | Medium objects like parts of `OSObject`.                                    |
| …                    | …            | …                                                                           |
| `default.kalloc.1280`| 1280 bytes   | Large structures, IOSurface/graphics metadata.                              |

**How it worked:**
- Each allocation request gets **rounded up** to the nearest zone size.  
  (E.g., a 50-byte request lands in the `kalloc.64` zone).  
- Memory in each zone was kept in a **free list** — chunks freed by the kernel went back into that zone.  
- If you overflowed a 64-byte buffer, you’d overwrite the **next object in the same zone**.  

This is why **heap spraying / feng shui** was so effective: you could predict object neighbors by spraying allocations of the same size class.

### The freelist

Inside each kalloc zone, freed objects weren’t returned directly to the system — they went into a freelist, a linked list of available chunks.

- When a chunk was freed, the kernel wrote a pointer at the start of that chunk → the address of the next free chunk in the same zone.

- The zone kept a HEAD pointer to the first free chunk.

- Allocation always used the current HEAD:

    1. Pop HEAD (return that memory to the caller).

    2. Update HEAD = HEAD->next (stored in the freed chunk’s header).

- Freeing pushed chunks back:

    - `freed_chunk->next = HEAD`

    - `HEAD = freed_chunk`

So the freelist was just a linked list built inside the freed memory itself.

Normal state:

```
Zone page (64-byte chunks for example):
   [ A ] [ F ] [ F ] [ A ] [ F ] [ A ] [ F ]

Freelist view:
   HEAD ──► [ F ] ──► [ F ] ──► [ F ] ──► [ F ] ──► NULL
              (next ptrs stored at start of freed chunks)
```

### Exploiting the freelist

Because the first 8 bytes of a free chunk = freelist pointer, an attacker could corrupt it:

    1. **Heap overflow** into an adjacent freed chunk → overwrite its “next” pointer.

    2. **Use-after-free** write into a freed object → overwrite its “next” pointer.

Then, on the next allocation of that size:

    - The allocator pops the corrupted chunk.

    - Follows the attacker-supplied “next” pointer.

    - Returns a pointer to arbitrary memory, enabling fake object primitives or targeted overwrite.

Visual example of freelist poisoning:

```
Before corruption:
   HEAD ──► [ F1 ] ──► [ F2 ] ──► [ F3 ] ──► NULL

After attacker overwrite of F1->next:
   HEAD ──► [ F1 ]
              (next) ──► 0xDEAD_BEEF_CAFE_BABE  (attacker-chosen)

Next alloc of this zone → kernel hands out memory at attacker-controlled address.
```

This freelist design made exploitation highly effective pre-hardening: predictable neighbors from heap sprays, raw pointer freelist links, and no type separation allowed attackers to escalate UAF/overflow bugs into arbitrary kernel memory control.

### Heap Grooming / Feng Shui
The goal of heap grooming is to **shape the heap layout** so that when an attacker triggers an overflow or use-after-free, the target (victim) object sits right next to an attacker-controlled object.\
That way, when memory corruption happens, the attacker can reliably overwrite the victim object with controlled data.

**Steps:**

1. Spray allocations (fill the holes)
   - Over time, the kernel heap gets fragmented: some zones have holes where old 
     objects were freed.
   - The attacker first makes lots of dummy allocations to fill these gaps, so 
     the heap becomes “packed” and predictable.

2. Force new pages
   - Once the holes are filled, the next allocations must come from new pages 
     added to the zone.
   - Fresh pages mean objects will be clustered together, not scattered across 
     old fragmented memory.
   - This gives the attacker much better control of neighbors.

3. Place attacker objects
   - The attacker now sprays again, creating lots of attacker-controlled objects 
     in those new pages.
   - These objects are predictable in size and placement (since they all belong 
     to the same zone).

4. Free a controlled object (make a gap)
   - The attacker deliberately frees one of their own objects.
   - This creates a “hole” in the heap, which the allocator will later reuse for 
     the next allocation of that size.

5. Victim object lands in the hole
   - The attacker triggers the kernel to allocate the victim object (the one 
     they want to corrupt).
   - Since the hole is the first available slot in the freelist, the victim is 
     placed exactly where the attacker freed their object.

6. Overflow / UAF into victim
   - Now the attacker has attacker-controlled objects around the victim.
   - By overflowing from one of their own objects (or reusing a freed one), they 
     can reliably overwrite the victim’s memory fields with chosen values.

**Why it works**:

- Zone allocator predictability: allocations of the same size always come from 
  the same zone.
- Freelist behavior: new allocations reuse the most recently freed chunk first.
- Heap sprays: attacker fills memory with predictable content and controls layout.
- End result: attacker controls where the victim object lands and what data sits 
  next to it.

## Modern Kernel Heap (iOS 15+/A12+ SoCs)

Apple hardened the allocator and made **heap grooming much harder**:

### 1. From Classic kalloc to kalloc_type
- **Before**: a single `kalloc.<size>` zone existed for each size class (16, 32, 64, … 1280, etc.). Any object of that size was placed there → attacker objects could sit next to privileged kernel objects.
- **Now**:
  - Kernel objects are allocated from **typed zones** (`kalloc_type`).
  - Each type of object (e.g., `ipc_port_t`, `task_t`, `OSString`, `OSData`) has its own dedicated zone, even if they’re the same size.
  - The mapping between object type ↔ zone is generated from the **kalloc_type system** at compile time.

An attacker can no longer guarantee that controlled data (`OSData`) ends up adjacent to sensitive kernel objects (`task_t`) of the same size.

### 2. Slabs and Per-CPU Caches
- The heap is divided into **slabs** (pages of memory carved into fixed-size chunks for that zone).
- Each zone has a **per-CPU cache** to reduce contention.
- Allocation path:
  1. Try per-CPU cache.
  2. If empty, pull from the global freelist.
  3. If freelist is empty, allocate a new slab (one or more pages).
- **Benefit**: This decentralization makes heap sprays less deterministic, since allocations may be satisfied from different CPUs’ caches.

### 3. Randomization inside zones
- Within a zone, freed elements are not handed back in simple FIFO/LIFO order.
- Modern XNU uses **encoded freelist pointers** (safe-linking like Linux, introduced ~iOS 14).
  - Each freelist pointer is **XOR-encoded** with a per-zone secret cookie.
  - This prevents attackers from forging a fake freelist pointer if they gain a write primitive.
- Some allocations are **randomized in their placement within a slab**, so spraying doesn’t guarantee adjacency.

### 4. Guarded Allocations
- Certain critical kernel objects (e.g., credentials, task structures) are allocated in **guarded zones**.
- These zones insert **guard pages** (unmapped memory) between slabs or use **redzones** around objects.
- Any overflow into the guard page triggers a fault → immediate panic instead of silent corruption.

### 5. Page Protection Layer (PPL) and SPTM
- Even if you control a freed object, you can’t modify all of kernel memory:
  - **PPL (Page Protection Layer)** enforces that certain regions (e.g., code signing data, entitlements) are **read-only** even to the kernel itself.
  - On **A15/M2+ devices**, this role is replaced/enhanced by **SPTM (Secure Page Table Monitor)** + **TXM (Trusted Execution Monitor)**.
- These hardware-enforced layers mean attackers can’t escalate from a single heap corruption to arbitrary patching of critical security structures.

### 6. Large Allocations
- Not all allocations go through `kalloc_type`.
- Very large requests (above ~16KB) bypass typed zones and are served directly from **kernel VM (kmem)** via page allocations.
- These are less predictable, but also less exploitable, since they don’t share slabs with other objects.

### 7. Allocation Patterns Attackers Target
Even with these protections, attackers still look for:
- **Reference count objects**: if you can tamper with retain/release counters, you may cause use-after-free.
- **Objects with function pointers (vtables)**: corrupting one still yields control flow.
- **Shared memory objects (IOSurface, Mach ports)**: these are still attack targets because they bridge user ↔ kernel.

But — unlike before — you can’t just spray `OSData` and expect it to neighbor a `task_t`. You need **type-specific bugs** or **info leaks** to succeed.

### Example: Allocation Flow in Modern Heap

Suppose userspace calls into IOKit to allocate an `OSData` object:

1. **Type lookup** → `OSData` maps to `kalloc_type_osdata` zone (size 64 bytes).
2. Check per-CPU cache for free elements.
   - If found → return one.
   - If empty → go to global freelist.
   - If freelist empty → allocate a new slab (page of 4KB → 64 chunks of 64 bytes).
3. Return chunk to caller.

**Freelist pointer protection**:
- Each freed chunk stores the address of the next free chunk, but encoded with a secret key.
- Overwriting that field with attacker data won’t work unless you know the key.

## Finding the right XNU version

If you want to check for vulnerabilities in a specific version of iOS, you can check which XNU release version the iOS version uses at [https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/kernel]https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/kernel).

For example, the versions `15.1 RC`, `15.1` and `15.1.1` use the version `Darwin Kernel Version 21.1.0: Wed Oct 13 19:14:48 PDT 2021; root:xnu-8019.43.1~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T8006`.
