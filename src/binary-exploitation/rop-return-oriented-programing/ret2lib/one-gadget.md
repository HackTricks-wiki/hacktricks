## Basic Information

[**One Gadget**](https://github.com/david942j/one_gadget) allows to obtain a shell instead of using **system** and **"/bin/sh". One Gadget** will find inside the libc library some way to obtain a shell (`execve("/bin/sh")`) using just one **address**.\
However, normally there are some constrains, the most common ones and easy to avoid are like `[rsp+0x30] == NULL` As you control the values inside the **RSP** you just have to send some more NULL values so the constrain is avoided.

```python
ONE_GADGET = libc.address + 0x4526a
rop2 = base + p64(ONE_GADGET) + "\x00"*100
```

To the address indicated by One Gadget you need to **add the base address where `libc`** is loaded.

> [!TIP]
> One Gadget is a **great help for Arbitrary Write 2 Exec techniques** and might **simplify ROP** **chains** as you only need to call one address (and fulfil the requirements).

### ARM64

The github repo mentions that **ARM64 is supported** by the tool, but when running it in the libc of a Kali 2023.3 **it doesn't find any gadget**.

## Angry Gadget

From the [**github repo**](https://github.com/ChrisTheCoolHut/angry_gadget): Inspired by [OneGadget](https://github.com/david942j/one_gadget) this tool is written in python and uses [angr](https://github.com/angr/angr) to test constraints for gadgets executing `execve('/bin/sh', NULL, NULL)`\
If you've run out gadgets to try from OneGadget, Angry Gadget gives a lot more with complicated constraints to try!

```bash
pip install angry_gadget

angry_gadget.py examples/libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64.so
```
