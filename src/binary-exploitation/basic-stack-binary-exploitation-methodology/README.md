## ELF Basic Info

Before start exploiting anything it's interesting to understand part of the structure of an **ELF binary**:

## Stack Overflow Methodology

With so many techniques it's good to have a scheme when each technique will be useful. Note that the same protections will affect different techniques. You can find ways to bypass the protections on each protection section but not in this methodology.

## Controlling the Flow

There are different was you could end controlling the flow of a program:

- [**Stack Overflows**](../stack-overflow/index.html) overwriting the return pointer from the stack or the EBP -> ESP -> EIP.
  - Might need to abuse an [**Integer Overflows**](../integer-overflow.md) to cause the overflow
- Or via **Arbitrary Writes + Write What Where to Execution**
  - [**Format strings**](../format-strings/index.html)**:** Abuse `printf` to write arbitrary content in arbitrary addresses.
  - [**Array Indexing**](../array-indexing.md): Abuse a poorly designed indexing to be able to control some arrays and get an arbitrary write.
    - Might need to abuse an [**Integer Overflows**](../integer-overflow.md) to cause the overflow
  - **bof to WWW via ROP**: Abuse a buffer overflow to construct a ROP and be able to get a WWW.

You can find the **Write What Where to Execution** techniques in:

## Eternal Loops

Something to take into account is that usually **just one exploitation of a vulnerability might not be enough** to execute a successful exploit, specially some protections need to be bypassed. Therefore, it's interesting discuss some options to **make a single vulnerability exploitable several times** in the same execution of the binary:

- Write in a **ROP** chain the address of the **`main` function** or to the address where the **vulnerability** is occurring.
  - Controlling a proper ROP chain you might be able to perform all the actions in that chain
- Write in the **`exit` address in GOT** (or any other function used by the binary before ending) the address to go **back to the vulnerability**
- As explained in [**.fini_array**](../arbitrary-write-2-exec/www2exec-.dtors-and-.fini_array.md#eternal-loop)**,** store 2 functions here, one to call the vuln again and another to call**`__libc_csu_fini`** which will call again the function from `.fini_array`.

## Exploitation Goals

### Goal: Call an Existing function

- [**ret2win**](#ret2win): There is a function in the code you need to call (maybe with some specific params) in order to get the flag.
  - In a **regular bof without** [**PIE**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/index.html) **and** [**canary**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/stack-canaries/index.html) you just need to write the address in the return address stored in the stack.
  - In a bof with [**PIE**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/index.html), you will need to bypass it
  - In a bof with [**canary**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/stack-canaries/index.html), you will need to bypass it
  - If you need to set several parameter to correctly call the **ret2win** function you can use:
    - A [**ROP**](#rop-and-ret2...-techniques) **chain if there are enough gadgets** to prepare all the params
    - [**SROP**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/srop-sigreturn-oriented-programming/index.html) (in case you can call this syscall) to control a lot of registers
    - Gadgets from [**ret2csu**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2csu.md) and [**ret2vdso**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2vdso.md) to control several registers
  - Via a [**Write What Where**](../arbitrary-write-2-exec/index.html) you could abuse other vulns (not bof) to call the **`win`** function.
- [**Pointers Redirecting**](../stack-overflow/pointer-redirecting.md): In case the stack contains pointers to a function that is going to be called or to a string that is going to be used by an interesting function (system or printf), it's possible to overwrite that address.
  - [**ASLR**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/index.html) or [**PIE**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/index.html) might affect the addresses.
- [**Uninitialized vatiables**](../stack-overflow/uninitialized-variables.md): You never know.

### Goal: RCE

#### Via shellcode, if nx disabled or mixing shellcode with ROP:

- [**(Stack) Shellcode**](#stack-shellcode): This is useful to store a shellcode in the stack before of after overwriting the return pointer and then **jump to it** to execute it:
  - **In any case, if there is a** [**canary**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/stack-canaries/index.html)**,** in a regular bof you will need to bypass (leak) it
  - **Without** [**ASLR**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/index.html) **and** [**nx**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/no-exec-nx.md) it's possible to jump to the address of the stack as it won't never change
  - **With** [**ASLR**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/index.html) you will need techniques such as [**ret2esp/ret2reg**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2esp-ret2reg.md) to jump to it
  - **With** [**nx**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/no-exec-nx.md), you will need to use some [**ROP**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/index.html) **to call `memprotect`** and make some page `rwx`, in order to then **store the shellcode in there** (calling read for example) and then jump there.
    - This will mix shellcode with a ROP chain.

#### Via syscalls

- [**Ret2syscall**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/rop-syscall-execv/index.html): Useful to call `execve` to run arbitrary commands. You need to be able to find the **gadgets to call the specific syscall with the parameters**.
  - If [**ASLR**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/index.html) or [**PIE**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/index.html) are enabled you'll need to defeat them **in order to use ROP gadgets** from the binary or libraries.
  - [**SROP**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/srop-sigreturn-oriented-programming/index.html) can be useful to prepare the **ret2execve**
  - Gadgets from [**ret2csu**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2csu.md) and [**ret2vdso**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2vdso.md) to control several registers

#### Via libc

- [**Ret2lib**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2lib/index.html): Useful to call a function from a library (usually from **`libc`**) like **`system`** with some prepared arguments (e.g. `'/bin/sh'`). You need the binary to **load the library** with the function you would like to call (libc usually).
  - If **statically compiled and no** [**PIE**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/index.html), the **address** of `system` and `/bin/sh` are not going to change, so it's possible to use them statically.
  - **Without** [**ASLR**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/index.html) **and knowing the libc version** loaded, the **address** of `system` and `/bin/sh` are not going to change, so it's possible to use them statically.
  - With [**ASLR**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/index.html) **but no** [**PIE**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/index.html)**, knowing the libc and with the binary using the `system`** function it's possible to **`ret` to the address of system in the GOT** with the address of `'/bin/sh'` in the param (you will need to figure this out).
  - With [ASLR](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/index.html) but no [PIE](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/index.html), knowing the libc and **without the binary using the `system`** :
    - Use [**`ret2dlresolve`**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2dlresolve.md) to resolve the address of `system` and call it
    - **Bypass** [**ASLR**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/index.html) and calculate the address of `system` and `'/bin/sh'` in memory.
  - **With** [**ASLR**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/index.html) **and** [**PIE**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/index.html) **and not knowing the libc**: You need to:
    - Bypass [**PIE**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/index.html)
    - Find the **`libc` version** used (leak a couple of function addresses)
    - Check the **previous scenarios with ASLR** to continue.

#### Via EBP/RBP

- [**Stack Pivoting / EBP2Ret / EBP Chaining**](../stack-overflow/stack-pivoting-ebp2ret-ebp-chaining.md): Control the ESP to control RET through the stored EBP in the stack.
  - Useful for **off-by-one** stack overflows
  - Useful as an alternate way to end controlling EIP while abusing EIP to construct the payload in memory and then jumping to it via EBP

#### Misc

- [**Pointers Redirecting**](../stack-overflow/pointer-redirecting.md): In case the stack contains pointers to a function that is going to be called or to a string that is going to be used by an interesting function (system or printf), it's possible to overwrite that address.
  - [**ASLR**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/index.html) or [**PIE**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/index.html) might affect the addresses.
- [**Uninitialized variables**](../stack-overflow/uninitialized-variables.md): You never know
