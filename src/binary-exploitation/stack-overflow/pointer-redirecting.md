## String pointers

If a function call is going to use an address of a string that is located in the stack, it's possible to abuse the buffer overflow to **overwrite this address** and put an **address to a different string** inside the binary.

If for example a **`system`** function call is going to **use the address of a string to execute a command**, an attacker could place the **address of a different string in the stack**, **`export PATH=.:$PATH`** and create in the current directory an **script with the name of the first letter of the new string** as this will be executed by the binary.

You can find an **example** of this in:

  - 32bit, change address to flags string in the stack so it's printed by `puts`

## Function pointers

Same as string pointer but applying to functions, if the **stack contains the address of a function** that will be called, it's possible to **change it** (e.g. to call **`system`**).

You can find an example in:
