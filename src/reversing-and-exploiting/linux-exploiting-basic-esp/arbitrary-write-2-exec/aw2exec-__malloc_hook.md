## **Malloc Hook**

As you can [Official GNU site](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Hooks-for-Malloc.html), the variable **`__malloc_hook`** is a pointer pointing to the **address of a function that will be called** whenever `malloc()` is called **stored in the data section of the libc library**. Therefore, if this address is overwritten with a **One Gadget** for example and `malloc` is called, the **One Gadget will be called**.

To call malloc it's possible to wait for the program to call it or by **calling `printf("%10000$c")`** which allocates too bytes many making `libc` calling malloc to allocate them in the heap.

> [!CAUTION]
> Note that hooks are **disabled for GLIBC >= 2.34**. There are other techniques that can be used on modern GLIBC versions. See [https://github.com/nobodyisnobody/docs/blob/main/code.execution.on.last.libc/README.md](https://github.com/nobodyisnobody/docs/blob/main/code.execution.on.last.libc/README.md).
