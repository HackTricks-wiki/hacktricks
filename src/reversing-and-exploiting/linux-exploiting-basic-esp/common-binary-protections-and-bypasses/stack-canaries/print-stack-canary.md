# Print Stack Canary

## Enlarge printed stack

Imagine a situation where a **program vulnerable** to stack overflow can execute a **puts** function **pointing** to **part** of the **stack overflow**. The attacker knows that the **first byte of the canary is a null byte** (`\x00`) and the rest of the canary are **random** bytes. Then, the attacker may create an overflow that **overwrites the stack until just the first byte of the canary**.

Then, the attacker **calls the puts functionalit**y on the middle of the payload which will **print all the canary** (except from the first null byte).

With this info the attacker can **craft and send a new attack** knowing the canary (in the same program session).

Obviously, this tactic is very **restricted** as the attacker needs to be able to **print** the **content** of his **payload** to **exfiltrate** the **canary** and then be able to create a new payload (in the **same program session**) and **send** the **real buffer overflow**.

**CTF examples:**

  - 64 bit, ASLR enabled but no PIE, the first step is to fill an overflow until the byte 0x00 of the canary to then call puts and leak it. With the canary a ROP gadget is created to call puts to leak the address of puts from the GOT and the a ROP gadget to call `system('/bin/sh')`

## Arbitrary Read

With an arbitrary read like the one provided by format **strings** it might be possible to leak the canary. Check this example: [**https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/canaries**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/canaries) and you can read about abusing format strings to read arbitrary memory addresses in:
