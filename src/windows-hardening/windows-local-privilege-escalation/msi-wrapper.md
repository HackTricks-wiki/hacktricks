# MSI Wrapper

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

Download the free version app from [https://www.exemsi.com/documentation/getting-started/](https://www.exemsi.com/download/), execute it and wrap the "malicious" binary on it.\
Note that you can wrap a "**.bat**" if you **just** want to **execute** **command lines (instead of cmd.exe select the .bat file)**

And this is the most important part of the configuration:

![](<../../images/image (312).png>)

![](<../../images/image (346).png>)

![](<../../images/image (1072).png>)

(Please, note that if you try to pack your own binary you will be able to modify these values)

From here just click on **next buttons** and the last **build button and your installer/wrapper will be generated.**
