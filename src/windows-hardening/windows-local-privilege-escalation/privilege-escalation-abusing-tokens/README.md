## Tokens

If you **don't know what are Windows Access Tokens** read this page before continuing:

**Maybe you could be able to escalate privileges abusing the tokens you already have**

### SeImpersonatePrivilege

This is privilege that is held by any process allows the impersonation (but not creation) of any token, given that a handle to it can be obtained. A privileged token can be acquired from a Windows service (DCOM) by inducing it to perform NTLM authentication against an exploit, subsequently enabling the execution of a process with SYSTEM privileges. This vulnerability can be exploited using various tools, such as [juicy-potato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato), [RogueWinRM](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RogueWinRM) (which requires winrm to be disabled), [SweetPotato](https://github.com/CCob/SweetPotato), [EfsPotato](https://github.com/zcgonvh/EfsPotato), [DCOMPotato](https://github.com/zcgonvh/DCOMPotato) and [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer).

### SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege

It is very similar to **SeImpersonatePrivilege**, it will use the **same method** to get a privileged token.\
Then, this privilege allows **to assign a primary token** to a new/suspended process. With the privileged impersonation token you can derivate a primary token (DuplicateTokenEx).\
With the token, you can create a **new process** with 'CreateProcessAsUser' or create a process suspended and **set the token** (in general, you cannot modify the primary token of a running process).

### SeTcbPrivilege

If you have enabled this token you can use **KERB_S4U_LOGON** to get an **impersonation token** for any other user without knowing the credentials, **add an arbitrary group** (admins) to the token, set the **integrity level** of the token to "**medium**", and assign this token to the **current thread** (SetThreadToken).

### SeBackupPrivilege

The system is caused to **grant all read access** control to any file (limited to read operations) by this privilege. It is utilized for **reading the password hashes of local Administrator** accounts from the registry, following which, tools like "**psexec**" or "**wmiexec**" can be used with the hash (Pass-the-Hash technique). However, this technique fails under two conditions: when the Local Administrator account is disabled, or when a policy is in place that removes administrative rights from Local Administrators connecting remotely.\
You can **abuse this privilege** with:

- Or as explained in the **escalating privileges with Backup Operators** section of:

../../active-directory-methodology/privileged-groups-and-token-privileges.md
{{#endref}}

### SeRestorePrivilege

Permission for **write access** to any system file, irrespective of the file's Access Control List (ACL), is provided by this privilege. It opens up numerous possibilities for escalation, including the ability to **modify services**, perform DLL Hijacking, and set **debuggers** via Image File Execution Options among various other techniques.

### SeCreateTokenPrivilege

SeCreateTokenPrivilege is a powerful permission, especially useful when a user possesses the ability to impersonate tokens, but also in the absence of SeImpersonatePrivilege. This capability hinges on the ability to impersonate a token that represents the same user and whose integrity level does not exceed that of the current process.

**Key Points:**

- **Impersonation without SeImpersonatePrivilege:** It's possible to leverage SeCreateTokenPrivilege for EoP by impersonating tokens under specific conditions.
- **Conditions for Token Impersonation:** Successful impersonation requires the target token to belong to the same user and have an integrity level that is less or equal to the integrity level of the process attempting impersonation.
- **Creation and Modification of Impersonation Tokens:** Users can create an impersonation token and enhance it by adding a privileged group's SID (Security Identifier).

### SeLoadDriverPrivilege

Thi privilege allows to **load and unload device drivers** with the creation of a registry entry with specific values for `ImagePath` and `Type`. Since direct write access to `HKLM` (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE) is restricted, `HKCU` (HKEY_CURRENT_USER) must be utilized instead. However, to make `HKCU` recognizable to the kernel for driver configuration, a specific path must be followed.

This path is `\Registry\User\<RID>\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\DriverName`, where `<RID>` is the Relative Identifier of the current user. Inside `HKCU`, this entire path must be created, and two values need to be set:

- `ImagePath`, which is the path to the binary to be executed
- `Type`, with a value of `SERVICE_KERNEL_DRIVER` (`0x00000001`).

**Steps to Follow:**

1. Access `HKCU` instead of `HKLM` due to restricted write access.
2. Create the path `\Registry\User\<RID>\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\DriverName` within `HKCU`, where `<RID>` represents the current user's Relative Identifier.
3. Set the `ImagePath` to the binary's execution path.
4. Assign the `Type` as `SERVICE_KERNEL_DRIVER` (`0x00000001`).

```python
# Example Python code to set the registry values
import winreg as reg

# Define the path and values
path = r'Software\YourPath\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\DriverName' # Adjust 'YourPath' as needed
key = reg.OpenKey(reg.HKEY_CURRENT_USER, path, 0, reg.KEY_WRITE)
reg.SetValueEx(key, "ImagePath", 0, reg.REG_SZ, "path_to_binary")
reg.SetValueEx(key, "Type", 0, reg.REG_DWORD, 0x00000001)
reg.CloseKey(key)
```

More ways to abuse this privilege in [https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/privileged-accounts-and-token-privileges#seloaddriverprivilege](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/privileged-accounts-and-token-privileges#seloaddriverprivilege)

### SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege

This is similar to to **SeRestorePrivilege**. Its primary function allows a process to **assume ownership of an object**, circumventing the requirement for explicit discretionary access through the provision of WRITE_OWNER access rights. The process involves first securing ownership of the intended registry key for writing purposes, then altering the DACL to enable write operations.

```bash
takeown /f 'C:\some\file.txt' #Now the file is owned by you
icacls 'C:\some\file.txt' /grant <your_username>:F #Now you have full access
# Use this with files that might contain credentials such as
%WINDIR%\repair\sam
%WINDIR%\repair\system
%WINDIR%\repair\software
%WINDIR%\repair\security
%WINDIR%\system32\config\security.sav
%WINDIR%\system32\config\software.sav
%WINDIR%\system32\config\system.sav
%WINDIR%\system32\config\SecEvent.Evt
%WINDIR%\system32\config\default.sav
c:\inetpub\wwwwroot\web.config
```

### SeDebugPrivilege

This privilege permits the **debug other processes**, including to read and write in the memore. Various strategies for memory injection, capable of evading most antivirus and host intrusion prevention solutions, can be employed with this privilege.

#### Dump memory

You could use [ProcDump](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump) from the [SysInternals Suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite) or [SharpDump](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpDump) to **capture the memory of a process**. Specifically, this can apply to the **Local Security Authority Subsystem Service ([LSASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Security_Authority_Subsystem_Service))** process, which is responsible for storing user credentials once a user has successfully logged into a system.

You can then load this dump in mimikatz to obtain passwords:

```
mimikatz.exe
mimikatz # log
mimikatz # sekurlsa::minidump lsass.dmp
mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```

#### RCE

If you want to get a `NT SYSTEM` shell you could use:

- [**SeDebugPrivilege-Exploit (C++)**](https://github.com/bruno-1337/SeDebugPrivilege-Exploit)
- [**SeDebugPrivilegePoC (C#)**](https://github.com/daem0nc0re/PrivFu/tree/main/PrivilegedOperations/SeDebugPrivilegePoC)
- [**psgetsys.ps1 (Powershell Script)**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/decoder-it/psgetsystem/master/psgetsys.ps1)

```bash
# Get the PID of a process running as NT SYSTEM
import-module psgetsys.ps1; [MyProcess]::CreateProcessFromParent(<system_pid>,<command_to_execute>)
```

### SeManageVolumePrivilege

The `SeManageVolumePrivilege` is a Windows user right that allows users to manage disk volumes, including creating and deleting them. While intended for administrators, if granted to non-admin users, it can be exploited for privilege escalation.

It's possible to leverage this privilege to manipulate volumes, leading to full volume access. The [SeManageVolumeExploit](https://github.com/CsEnox/SeManageVolumeExploit) can be used to give full access to all users for C:\

Additionally, the process outlined in [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@raphaeltzy13/exploiting-semanagevolumeprivilege-with-dll-hijacking-windows-privilege-escalation-1a4f28372d37) describes using DLL hijacking in conjunction with `SeManageVolumePrivilege` to escalate privileges.
By placing a payload DLL `C:\Windows\System32\wbem\tzres.dll` and calling `systeminfo` the dll is executed.

## Check privileges

```
whoami /priv
```

The **tokens that appear as Disabled** can be enable, you you actually can abuse _Enabled_ and _Disabled_ tokens.

### Enable All the tokens

If you have tokens disables, you can use the script [**EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fashionproof/EnableAllTokenPrivs/master/EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1) to enable all the tokens:

```bash
.\EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1
whoami /priv
```
