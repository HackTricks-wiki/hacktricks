## What is Mythic?

Mythic is an open-source, modular command and control (C2) framework designed for red teaming . It allows security professionals to manage and deploy various agents (payloads) across different operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. Mythic provides a user-friendly web interface for managing agents, executing commands, and collecting results, making it a powerful tool for simulating real-world attacks in a controlled environment.

### Installation

To install Mythic, follow the instructions on the official **[Mythic repo](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic)**.

### Agents

Mythic supports multiple agents, which are the **payloads that perform tasks on the compromised systems**. Each agent can be tailored to specific needs and can run on different operating systems.

By default Mythic doesn't have any agents installed. However, it offers some open source agent in [**https://github.com/MythicAgents**](https://github.com/MythicAgents).

To install an agent from that repo you just need to run:

```bash
sudo ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/<agent-name>
sudo ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/apfell
```

You can add new agents with the previous command even if Mythic is already running.

### C2 Profiles

C2 profiles in Mythic define **how agents communicate with the Mythic server**. They specify the communication protocol, encryption methods, and other settings. You can create and manage C2 profiles through the Mythic web interface.

By default Mythic is installed with no profiles, however, it's possible to download some profiles from the repo [**https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles**](https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles) running:

```bash
sudo ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/<c2-profile>>
sudo ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/http
```

## [Apollo Agent](https://github.com/MythicAgents/Apollo)

Apollo is a Windows agent written in C# using the 4.0 .NET Framework designed to be used in SpecterOps training offerings.

Install it with:

```bash
./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/Apollo.git
```

This agent has a lot of commands that makes it very similar to Cobalt Strike's Beacon with some extras. Among them, it supports:

### Common actions

- `cat`: Print the contents of a file
- `cd`: Change the current working directory
- `cp`: Copy a file from one location to another
- `ls`: List files and directories in the current directory or specified path
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory
- `ps`: List running processes on the target system (with added info)
- `download`: Download a file from the target system to the local machine
- `upload`: Upload a file from the local machine to the target system
- `reg_query`: Query registry keys and values on the target system
- `reg_write_value`: Write a new value to a specified registry key
- `sleep`: Change the agent's sleep interval, which determines how often it checks in with the Mythic server
- And may others, use `help` to see the full list of available commands.

### Privilege escalation

- `getprivs`: Enable as many privileges as possible on the current thread token
- `getsystem`: Open a handle to winlogon and duplicate the token, effectively escalating privileges to SYSTEM level
- `make_token`: Create a new logon session and apply it to the agent, allowing for impersonation of another user
- `steal_token`: Steal a primary token from another process, allowing the agent to impersonate that process's user
- `pth`: Pass-the-Hash attack, allowing the agent to authenticate as a user using their NTLM hash without needing the plaintext password
- `mimikatz`: Run Mimikatz commands to extract credentials, hashes, and other sensitive information from memory or the SAM database
- `rev2self`: Revert the agent's token to its primary token, effectively dropping privileges back to the original level
- `ppid`: Change the parent process for post-exploitation jobs by specifying a new parent process ID, allowing for better control over job execution context
- `printspoofer`: Execute PrintSpoofer commands to bypass print spooler security measures, allowing for privilege escalation or code execution
- `dcsync`: Sync a user's Kerberos keys to the local machine, allowing for offline password cracking or further attacks
- `ticket_cache_add`: Add a Kerberos ticket to the current logon session or a specified one, allowing for ticket reuse or impersonation

### Process execution

- `assembly_inject`: Allows to inject a .NET assembly loader into a remote process
- `execute_assembly`: Executes a .NET assembly in the context of the agent
- `execute_coff`: Executes a COFF file in memory, allowing for in-memory execution of compiled code
- `execute_pe`: Executes an unmanaged executable (PE)
- `inline_assembly`: Executes a .NET assembly in a disposable AppDomain, allowing for temporary execution of code without affecting the agent's main process
- `run`: Executes a binary on the target system, using the system's PATH to find the executable
- `shinject`: Injects shellcode into a remote process, allowing for in-memory execution of arbitrary code
- `inject`: Injects agent shellcode into a remote process, allowing for in-memory execution of the agent's code
- `spawn`: Spawns a new agent session in the specified executable, allowing for the execution of shellcode in a new process
- `spawnto_x64` and `spawnto_x86`: Change the default binary used in post-exploitation jobs to a specified path instead of using `rundll32.exe` without params which is very noisy.

### Mithic Forge

This allows to **load COFF/BOF** files from the Mythic Forge, which is a repository of pre-compiled payloads and tools that can be executed on the target system. With all the commands that can be loaded it'll be possible to perform common actions executing them in the current agent process as BOFs (more steath usually).

Start installing them with:

```bash
./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/forge.git
```

Then, use `forge_collections` to show the a COFF/BOF modules from the Mythic Forge to be able to select and load them into the agent's memory for execution. By default, the following 2 collections are added in Apollo: 

- `forge_collections {"collectionName":"SharpCollection"}`
- `forge_collections {"collectionName":"SliverArmory"}`

After one module is loaded, it'll appear in the list as another command like `forge_bof_sa-whoami` or `forge_bof_sa-netuser`.

### Powershell & scripting execution

- `powershell_import`: Imports a new PowerShell script (.ps1) into the agent cache for later execution
- `powershell`: Executes a PowerShell command in the context of the agent, allowing for advanced scripting and automation
- `powerpick`: Injects a PowerShell loader assembly into a sacrificial process and executes a PowerShell command (without powershell logging).
- `psinject`: Executes PowerShell in a specified process, allowing for targeted execution of scripts in the context of another process
- `shell`: Executes a shell command in the context of the agent, similar to running a command in cmd.exe

### Lateral Movement

- `jump_psexec`: Uses the PsExec technique to move laterally to a new host by first copying over the Apollo agent executable (apollo.exe) and executing it.
- `jump_wmi`: Uses the WMI technique to move laterally to a new host by first copying over the Apollo agent executable (apollo.exe) and executing it.
- `wmiexecute`: Executes a command on the local or specified remote system using WMI, with optional credentials for impersonation.
- `net_dclist`: Retrieves a list of domain controllers for the specified domain, useful for identifying potential targets for lateral movement.
- `net_localgroup`: Lists local groups on the specified computer, defaulting to localhost if no computer is specified.
- `net_localgroup_member`: Retrieves local group membership for a specified group on the local or remote computer, allowing for enumeration of users in specific groups.
- `net_shares`: Lists remote shares and their accessibility on the specified computer, useful for identifying potential targets for lateral movement.
- `socks`: Enables a SOCKS 5 compliant proxy on the target network, allowing for tunneling of traffic through the compromised host. Compatible with tools like proxychains.
- `rpfwd`: Starts listening on a specified port on the target host and forwards traffic through Mythic to a remote IP and port, allowing for remote access to services on the target network.
- `listpipes`: Lists all named pipes on the local system, which can be useful for lateral movement or privilege escalation by interacting with IPC mechanisms.

### Miscellaneous Commands
- `help`: Displays detailed information about specific commands or general information about all available commands in the agent.
- `clear`: Marks tasks as 'cleared' so they can't be picked up by agents. You can specify `all` to clear all tasks or `task Num` to clear a specific task.
