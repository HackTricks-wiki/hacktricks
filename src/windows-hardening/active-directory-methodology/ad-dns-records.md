# AD DNS Records

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

By default **any user** in Active Directory can **enumerate all DNS records** in the Domain or Forest DNS zones, similar to a zone transfer (users can list the child objects of a DNS zone in an AD environment).

The tool [**adidnsdump**](https://github.com/dirkjanm/adidnsdump) enables **enumeration** and **exporting** of **all DNS records** in the zone for recon purposes of internal networks.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dirkjanm/adidnsdump
cd adidnsdump
pip install .

adidnsdump -u domain_name\\username ldap://10.10.10.10 -r
cat records.csv
```
