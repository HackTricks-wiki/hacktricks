# Get signature info
ldid -h <binary>

# Get entitlements
ldid -e <binary>

# Change entilements
## /tmp/entl.xml is a XML file with the new entitlements to add
ldid -S/tmp/entl.xml <binary>
```

### SuspiciousPackage

[**SuspiciousPackage**](https://mothersruin.com/software/SuspiciousPackage/get.html) is a tool useful to inspect **.pkg** files (installers) and see what is inside before installing it.\
These installers have `preinstall` and `postinstall` bash scripts that malware authors usually abuse to **persist** **the** **malware**.

### hdiutil

This tool allows to **mount** Apple disk images (**.dmg**) files to inspect them before running anything:

```bash
hdiutil attach ~/Downloads/Firefox\ 58.0.2.dmg
```

It will be mounted in `/Volumes`

### Packed binaries

- Check for high entropy
- Check the strings (is there is almost no understandable string, packed)
- The UPX packer for MacOS generates a section called "\_\_XHDR"

## Static Objective-C analysis

### Metadata

> [!CAUTION]
> Note that programs written in Objective-C **retain** their class declarations **when** **compiled** into [Mach-O binaries](../macos-files-folders-and-binaries/universal-binaries-and-mach-o-format.md). Such class declarations **include** the name and type of:

- The interfaces defined
- The interface methods
- The interface instance variables
- The protocols defined

Note that this names could be obfuscated to make the reversing of the binary more difficult.

### Function calling

When a function is called in a binary that uses objective-C, the compiled code instead of calling that function, it will call **`objc_msgSend`**. Which will be calling the final function:

![](<../../../images/image (305).png>)

The params this function expects are:

- The first parameter (**self**) is "a pointer that points to the **instance of the class that is to receive the message**". Or more simply put, it’s the object that the method is being invoked upon. If the method is a class method, this will be an instance of the class object (as a whole), whereas for an instance method, self will point to an instantiated instance of the class as an object.
- The second parameter, (**op**), is "the selector of the method that handles the message". Again, more simply put, this is just the **name of the method.**
- The remaining parameters are any **values that are required by the method** (op).

See how to **get this info easily with `lldb` in ARM64** in this page:

### Dump ObjectiveC metadata

### Dynadump

[**Dynadump**](https://github.com/DerekSelander/dynadump) is a tool to class-dump Objective-C binaries. The github specifies dylibs but this also works with executables.

```bash
./dynadump dump /path/to/bin
```

At the time of the writing, this is **currently the one that works the best**.

#### Regular tools

```bash
nm --dyldinfo-only /path/to/bin
otool -ov /path/to/bin
objdump --macho --objc-meta-data /path/to/bin
```

#### class-dump

[**class-dump**](https://github.com/nygard/class-dump/) is the original tool to generates declarations for the classes, categories and protocols in ObjetiveC formatted code.

It's old and unmaintained so it probably won't work properly.

#### ICDump

[**iCDump**](https://github.com/romainthomas/iCDump) is a modern and cross-platform Objective-C class dump. Compared to existing tools, iCDump can run independently from the Apple ecosystem and it exposes Python bindings.

```python
import icdump
metadata = icdump.objc.parse("/path/to/bin")

print(metadata.to_decl())
```

## Static Swift analysis

With Swift binaries, since there is Objective-C compatibility, sometimes you can extract declarations using [class-dump](https://github.com/nygard/class-dump/) but not always.

With the **`jtool -l`** or **`otool -l`** command lines it's possible ti find several sections that start with **`__swift5`** prefix:

```bash
jtool2 -l /Applications/Stocks.app/Contents/MacOS/Stocks
LC 00: LC_SEGMENT_64              Mem: 0x000000000-0x100000000    __PAGEZERO
LC 01: LC_SEGMENT_64              Mem: 0x100000000-0x100028000    __TEXT
    [...]
    Mem: 0x100026630-0x100026d54        __TEXT.__swift5_typeref
    Mem: 0x100026d60-0x100027061        __TEXT.__swift5_reflstr
    Mem: 0x100027064-0x1000274cc        __TEXT.__swift5_fieldmd
    Mem: 0x1000274cc-0x100027608        __TEXT.__swift5_capture
    [...]
```

You can find further information about the [**information stored in these section in this blog post**](https://knight.sc/reverse%20engineering/2019/07/17/swift-metadata.html).

Moreover, **Swift binaries might have symbols** (for example libraries need to store symbols so its functions can be called). The **symbols usually have the info about the function name** and attr in a ugly way, so they are very useful and there are "**demanglers"** that can get the original name:

```bash
# Ghidra plugin
https://github.com/ghidraninja/ghidra_scripts/blob/master/swift_demangler.py

# Swift cli
swift demangle
```

## Dynamic Analysis

> [!WARNING]
> Note that in order to debug binaries, **SIP needs to be disabled** (`csrutil disable` or `csrutil enable --without debug`) or to copy the binaries to a temporary folder and **remove the signature** with `codesign --remove-signature <binary-path>` or allow the debugging of the binary (you can use [this script](https://gist.github.com/carlospolop/a66b8d72bb8f43913c4b5ae45672578b))

> [!WARNING]
> Note that in order to **instrument system binaries**, (such as `cloudconfigurationd`) on macOS, **SIP must be disabled** (just removing the signature won't work).

### APIs

macOS exposes some interesting APIs that give information about the processes:

- `proc_info`: This is the main one giving a lot of information about each process. You need to be root to get other processes information but you don't need special entitlements or mach ports.
- `libsysmon.dylib`: It allows to get information about processes via XPC exposed functions, however, it's needed to have the entitlement `com.apple.sysmond.client`.

### Stackshot & microstackshots

**Stackshotting** is a technique used to capture the state of the processes, including the call stacks of all running threads. This is particularly useful for debugging, performance analysis, and understanding the behavior of the system at a specific point in time. On iOS and macOS, stackshotting can be performed using several tools and methods like the tools **`sample`** and **`spindump`**.

### Sysdiagnose

This tool (`/usr/bini/ysdiagnose`) basically collects a lot of information from your computer executing tens of different commands such as `ps`, `zprint`...

It must be run as **root** and the daemon `/usr/libexec/sysdiagnosed` has very interesting entitlements such as `com.apple.system-task-ports` and `get-task-allow`.

Its plist is located in `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.sysdiagnose.plist` which declares 3 MachServices:

- `com.apple.sysdiagnose.CacheDelete`: Deletes old archives in /var/rmp
- `com.apple.sysdiagnose.kernel.ipc`: Special port 23 (kernel)
- `com.apple.sysdiagnose.service.xpc`: User mode interface through `Libsysdiagnose` Obj-C class. Three arguments in a dict can be passed (`compress`, `display`, `run`)

### Unified Logs

MacOS generates a lot of logs that can be very useful when running an application trying to understand **what is it doing**.

Moreover, the are some logs that will contain the tag `<private>` to **hide** some **user** or **computer** **identifiable** information. However, it's possible to **install a certificate to disclose this information**. Follow the explanations from [**here**](https://superuser.com/questions/1532031/how-to-show-private-data-in-macos-unified-log).

### Hopper

#### Left panel

In the left panel of hopper it's possible to see the symbols (**Labels**) of the binary, the list of procedures and functions (**Proc**) and the strings (**Str**). Those aren't all the strings but the ones defined in several parts of the Mac-O file (like _cstring or_ `objc_methname`).

#### Middle panel

In the middle panel you can see the **dissasembled code**. And you can see it a **raw** disassemble, as **graph**, as **decompiled** and as **binary** by clicking on the respective icon:

<figure><img src="../../../images/image (343).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Right clicking in a code object you can see **references to/from that object** or even change its name (this doesn't work in decompiled pseudocode):

<figure><img src="../../../images/image (1117).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Moreover, in the **middle down you can write python commands**.

#### Right panel

In the right panel you can see interesting information such as the **navigation history** (so you know how you arrived at the current situation), the **call grap**h where you can see all the **functions that call this function** and all the functions that **this function calls**, and **local variables** information.

### dtrace

It allows users access to applications at an extremely **low level** and provides a way for users to **trace** **programs** and even change their execution flow. Dtrace uses **probes** which are **placed throughout the kernel** and are at locations such as the beginning and end of system calls.

DTrace uses the **`dtrace_probe_create`** function to create a probe for each system call. These probes can be fired in the **entry and exit point of each system call**. The interaction with DTrace occur through /dev/dtrace which is only available for the root user.

> [!TIP]
> To enable Dtrace without fully disabling SIP protection you could execute on recovery mode: `csrutil enable --without dtrace`
>
> You can also **`dtrace`** or **`dtruss`** binaries that **you have compiled**.

The available probes of dtrace can be obtained with:

```bash
dtrace -l | head
   ID   PROVIDER            MODULE                          FUNCTION NAME
    1     dtrace                                                     BEGIN
    2     dtrace                                                     END
    3     dtrace                                                     ERROR
   43    profile                                                     profile-97
   44    profile                                                     profile-199
```

The probe name consists of four parts: the provider, module, function, and name (`fbt:mach_kernel:ptrace:entry`). If you not specifies some part of the name, Dtrace will apply that part as a wildcard.

To configure DTrace to activate probes and to specify what actions to perform when they fire, we will need to use the D language.

A more detailed explanation and more examples can be found in [https://illumos.org/books/dtrace/chp-intro.html](https://illumos.org/books/dtrace/chp-intro.html)

#### Examples

Run `man -k dtrace` to list the **DTrace scripts available**. Example: `sudo dtruss -n binary`

- In line

```bash
#Count the number of syscalls of each running process
sudo dtrace -n 'syscall:::entry {@[execname] = count()}'
```

- script

```bash
syscall:::entry
/pid == $1/
{
}

#Log every syscall of a PID
sudo dtrace -s script.d 1234
```

```bash
syscall::open:entry
{
    printf("%s(%s)", probefunc, copyinstr(arg0));
}
syscall::close:entry
{
        printf("%s(%d)\n", probefunc, arg0);
}

#Log files opened and closed by a process
sudo dtrace -s b.d -c "cat /etc/hosts"
```

```bash
syscall:::entry
{
        ;
}
syscall:::return
{
        printf("=%d\n", arg1);
}

#Log sys calls with values
sudo dtrace -s syscalls_info.d -c "cat /etc/hosts"
```

### dtruss

```bash
dtruss -c ls #Get syscalls of ls
dtruss -c -p 1000 #get syscalls of PID 1000
```

### kdebug

It's a kernel tracing facility. The documented codes can be found in **`/usr/share/misc/trace.codes`**.

Tools like `latency`, `sc_usage`, `fs_usage` and `trace` use it internally.

To interface with `kdebug` `sysctl` is used over the `kern.kdebug` namespace and the MIBs to use can be found in `sys/sysctl.h` having the functions implemented in `bsd/kern/kdebug.c`.

To interact with kdebug with a custom client these are usually the steps:

- Remove existing settings with KERN_KDSETREMOVE
- Set trace with KERN_KDSETBUF and KERN_KDSETUP
- Use KERN_KDGETBUF to get number of buffer entries
- Get the own client out of the trace with KERN_KDPINDEX
- Enable tracing with KERN_KDENABLE
- Read the buffer calling KERN_KDREADTR
- To match each thread with its process call KERN_KDTHRMAP.

In order to get this information it's possible to use the Apple tool **`trace`** or the custom tool [kDebugView (kdv)](https://newosxbook.com/tools/kdv.html)**.**

**Note that Kdebug is only available for 1 costumer at a time.** So only one k-debug powered tool can be executed at the same time.

### ktrace

The `ktrace_*` APIs come from `libktrace.dylib` which wrap those of `Kdebug`. Then, a client can just call `ktrace_session_create` and `ktrace_events_[single/class]` to set callbacks on specific codes and then start it with `ktrace_start`.

You can use this one even with **SIP activated**

You can use as clients the utility `ktrace`:

```bash
ktrace trace -s -S -t c -c ls | grep "ls("
```

Or `tailspin`.

### kperf

This is used to do a kernel level profiling and it's built using `Kdebug` callouts.

Basically, the global variable `kernel_debug_active` is checked and is set it calls `kperf_kdebug_handler` withe `Kdebug` code and address of the kernel frame calling. If the `Kdebug` code matches one selected it gets the "actions" configured as a bitmap (check `osfmk/kperf/action.h` for the options).

Kperf has a sysctl MIB table also: (as root) `sysctl kperf`. These code can be found in `osfmk/kperf/kperfbsd.c`.

Moreover, a subset of Kperfs functionality resides in `kpc`, which provides information about machine performance counters.

### ProcessMonitor

[**ProcessMonitor**](https://objective-see.com/products/utilities.html#ProcessMonitor) is a very useful tool to check the process related actions a process is performing (for example, monitor which new processes a process is creating).

### SpriteTree

[**SpriteTree**](https://themittenmac.com/tools/) is a tool to prints the relations between processes.\
You need to monitor your mac with a command like **`sudo eslogger fork exec rename create > cap.json`** (the terminal launching this required FDA). And then you can load the json in this tool to view all the relations:

<figure><img src="../../../images/image (1182).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### FileMonitor

[**FileMonitor**](https://objective-see.com/products/utilities.html#FileMonitor) allows to monitor file events (such as creation, modifications, and deletions) providing detailed information about such events.

### Crescendo

[**Crescendo**](https://github.com/SuprHackerSteve/Crescendo) is a GUI tool with the look and feel Windows users may know from Microsoft Sysinternal’s _Procmon_. This tool allows the recording of various event types to be started and stopped, allows for the filtering of these events by categories such as file, process, network, etc., and provides the functionality to save the events recorded in a json format.

### Apple Instruments

[**Apple Instruments**](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/CellularBestPractices/Appendix/Appendix.html) are part of Xcode’s Developer tools – used for monitoring application performance, identifying memory leaks and tracking filesystem activity.

![](<../../../images/image (1138).png>)

### fs_usage

Allows to follow actions performed by processes:

```bash
fs_usage -w -f filesys ls #This tracks filesystem actions of proccess names containing ls
fs_usage -w -f network curl #This tracks network actions
```

### TaskExplorer

[**Taskexplorer**](https://objective-see.com/products/taskexplorer.html) is useful to see the **libraries** used by a binary, the **files** it's using and the **network** connections.\
It also checks the binary processes against **virustotal** and show information about the binary.

## PT_DENY_ATTACH <a href="#page-title" id="page-title"></a>

In [**this blog post**](https://knight.sc/debugging/2019/06/03/debugging-apple-binaries-that-use-pt-deny-attach.html) you can find an example about how to **debug a running daemon** that used **`PT_DENY_ATTACH`** to prevent debugging even if SIP was disabled.

### lldb

**lldb** is the de **facto tool** for **macOS** binary **debugging**.

```bash
lldb ./malware.bin
lldb -p 1122
lldb -n malware.bin
lldb -n malware.bin --waitfor
```

You can set intel flavour when using lldb creating a file called **`.lldbinit`** in your home folder with the following line:

```bash
settings set target.x86-disassembly-flavor intel
```

> [!WARNING]

### Anti-Dynamic Analysis

#### VM detection

- The command **`sysctl hw.model`** returns "Mac" when the **host is a MacOS** but something different when it's a VM.
- Playing with the values of **`hw.logicalcpu`** and **`hw.physicalcpu`** some malwares try to detect if it's a VM.
- Some malwares can also **detect** if the machine is **VMware** based on the MAC address (00:50:56).
- It's also possible to find **if a process is being debugged** with a simple code such us:
  - `if(P_TRACED == (info.kp_proc.p_flag & P_TRACED)){ //process being debugged }`
- It can also invoke the **`ptrace`** system call with the **`PT_DENY_ATTACH`** flag. This **prevents** a deb**u**gger from attaching and tracing.
  - You can check if the **`sysctl`** or **`ptrace`** function is being **imported** (but the malware could import it dynamically)
  - As noted in this writeup, “[Defeating Anti-Debug Techniques: macOS ptrace variants](https://alexomara.com/blog/defeating-anti-debug-techniques-macos-ptrace-variants/)” :\
    “_The message Process # exited with **status = 45 (0x0000002d)** is usually a tell-tale sign that the debug target is using **PT_DENY_ATTACH**_”

## Core Dumps

Core dumps are created if:

- `kern.coredump` sysctl is set to 1 (by default)
- If the process wasn't suid/sgid or `kern.sugid_coredump` is 1 (by default is 0)
- The `AS_CORE` limit allows the operation. It's possible to suppress code dumps creation by calling `ulimit -c 0` and re-enable them with `ulimit -c unlimited`.

In those cases the core dumps is generated according to `kern.corefile` sysctl and stored usually in `/cores/core/.%P`.

## Fuzzing

### [ReportCrash](https://ss64.com/osx/reportcrash.html)

ReportCrash **analyzes crashing processes and saves a crash report to disk**. A crash report contains information that can **help a developer diagnose** the cause of a crash.\
For applications and other processes **running in the per-user launchd context**, ReportCrash runs as a LaunchAgent and saves crash reports in the user's `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/`\
For daemons, other processes **running in the system launchd context** and other privileged processes, ReportCrash runs as a LaunchDaemon and saves crash reports in the system's `/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`

If you are worried about crash reports **being sent to Apple** you can disable them. If not, crash reports can be useful to **figure out how a server crashed**.

```bash
#To disable crash reporting:
launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ReportCrash.plist
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.ReportCrash.Root.plist

#To re-enable crash reporting:
launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ReportCrash.plist
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.ReportCrash.Root.plist
```

### Sleep

While fuzzing in a MacOS it's important to not allow the Mac to sleep:

- systemsetup -setsleep Never
- pmset, System Preferences
- [KeepingYouAwake](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake)

#### SSH Disconnect

If you are fuzzing via a SSH connection it's important to make sure the session isn't going to day. So change the sshd_config file with:

- TCPKeepAlive Yes
- ClientAliveInterval 0
- ClientAliveCountMax 0

```bash
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
```

### Internal Handlers

**Checkout the following page** to find out how you can find which app is responsible of **handling the specified scheme or protocol:**

{{#ref}}
../macos-file-extension-apps.md
{{#endref}}

### Enumerating Network Processes

This interesting to find processes that are managing network data:

```bash
dtrace -n 'syscall::recv*:entry { printf("-> %s (pid=%d)", execname, pid); }' >> recv.log
#wait some time
sort -u recv.log > procs.txt
cat procs.txt
```

Or use `netstat` or `lsof`

### Libgmalloc

<figure><img src="../../../images/Pasted Graphic 14.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

```bash
lldb -o "target create `which some-binary`" -o "settings set target.env-vars DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib" -o "run arg1 arg2" -o "bt" -o "reg read" -o "dis -s \$pc-32 -c 24 -m -F intel" -o "quit"
```

### Fuzzers

#### [AFL++](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus)

Works for CLI tools

#### [Litefuzz](https://github.com/sec-tools/litefuzz)

It "**just works"** with macOS GUI tools. Note some some macOS apps have some specific requirements like unique filenames, the right extension, need to read the files from the sandbox (`~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data`)...

Some examples:

```bash
# iBooks
litefuzz -l -c "/System/Applications/Books.app/Contents/MacOS/Books FUZZ" -i files/epub -o crashes/ibooks -t /Users/test/Library/Containers/com.apple.iBooksX/Data/tmp -x 10 -n 100000 -ez

# -l : Local
# -c : cmdline with FUZZ word (if not stdin is used)
# -i : input directory or file
# -o : Dir to output crashes
# -t : Dir to output runtime fuzzing artifacts
# -x : Tmeout for the run (default is 1)
# -n : Num of fuzzing iterations (default is 1)
# -e : enable second round fuzzing where any crashes found are reused as inputs
# -z : enable malloc debug helpers

# Font Book
litefuzz -l -c "/System/Applications/Font Book.app/Contents/MacOS/Font Book FUZZ" -i input/fonts -o crashes/font-book -x 2 -n 500000 -ez

# smbutil (using pcap capture)
litefuzz -lk -c "smbutil view smb://localhost:4455" -a tcp://localhost:4455 -i input/mac-smb-resp -p -n 100000 -z

# screensharingd (using pcap capture)
litefuzz -s -a tcp://localhost:5900 -i input/screenshared-session --reportcrash screensharingd -p -n 100000
```
