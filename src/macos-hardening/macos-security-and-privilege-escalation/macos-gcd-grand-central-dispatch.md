## Basic Information

**Grand Central Dispatch (GCD),** also known as **libdispatch** (`libdispatch.dyld`), is available in both macOS and iOS. It's a technology developed by Apple to optimize application support for concurrent (multithreaded) execution on multicore hardware.

**GCD** provides and manages **FIFO queues** to which your application can **submit tasks** in the form of **block objects**. Blocks submitted to dispatch queues are **executed on a pool of threads** fully managed by the system. GCD automatically creates threads for executing the tasks in the dispatch queues and schedules those tasks to run on the available cores.

> [!TIP]
> In summary, to execute code in **parallel**, processes can send **blocks of code to GCD**, which will take care of their execution. Therefore, processes don't create new threads; **GCD executes the given code with its own pool of threads** (which might increase or decrease as necessary).

This is very helpful to manage parallel execution successfully, greatly reducing the number of threads processes create and optimising the parallel execution. This is ideal for tasks that require **great parallelism** (brute-forcing?) or for tasks that shouldn't block the main thread: For example, the main thread on iOS handles UI interactions, so any other functionality that could make the app hang (searching, accessing a web, reading a file...) is managed this way.

### Blocks

A block is a **self contained section of code** (like a function with arguments returning a value) and can also specify bound variables.\
However, at compiler level blocks doesn't exist, they are `os_object`s. Each of these objects is formed by two structures:

- **block literal**:
  - It starts by the **`isa`** field, pointing to the block's class:
    - `NSConcreteGlobalBlock` (blocks from `__DATA.__const`)
    - `NSConcreteMallocBlock` (blocks in the heap)
    - `NSConcreateStackBlock` (blocks in stack)
  - It has **`flags`** (indicating fields present in the block descriptor) and some reserved bytes
  - The function pointer to call
  - A pointer to the block descriptor
  - Block imported variables (if any)
- **block descriptor**: It's size depends on the data that is present (as indicated in the previous flags)
  - It has some reserved bytes
  - The size of it
  - It'll usually have a pointer to an Objective-C style signature to know how much space is needed for the params (flag `BLOCK_HAS_SIGNATURE`)
  - If variables are referenced, this block will also have pointers to a copy helper (copying the value at the begining) and dispose helper (freeing it).

### Queues

A dispatch queue is a named object providing FIFO ordering of blocks for executions.

Blocks a set in queues to be executed, and these support 2 modes: `DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL` and `DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT`. Of course the **serial** one **won't have race condition** problems as a block won't be executed until the previous one has finished. But **the other type of queue might have it**.

Default queues:

- `.main-thread`: From `dispatch_get_main_queue()`
- `.libdispatch-manager`: GCD's queue manager
- `.root.libdispatch-manager`: GCD's queue manager
- `.root.maintenance-qos`: Lowest priority tasks
- `.root.maintenance-qos.overcommit`
- `.root.background-qos`: Available as `DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND`
- `.root.background-qos.overcommit`
- `.root.utility-qos`: Available as `DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_NON_INTERACTIVE`
- `.root.utility-qos.overcommit`
- `.root.default-qos`: Available as `DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT`
- `.root.background-qos.overcommit`
- `.root.user-initiated-qos`: Available as `DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH`
- `.root.background-qos.overcommit`
- `.root.user-interactive-qos`: Highest priority
- `.root.background-qos.overcommit`

Notice that it will be the system who decides **which threads handle which queues at each time** (multiple threads might work in the same queue or the same thread might work in different queues at some point)

#### Attributtes

When creating a queue with **`dispatch_queue_create`** the third argument is a `dispatch_queue_attr_t`, which usually is either `DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL` (which is actually NULL) or `DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT` which is a pointer to a `dispatch_queue_attr_t` struct which allow to control some parameters of the queue.

### Dispatch objects

There are several objects that libdispatch uses and queues and blocks are just 2 of them. It's possible to create these objects with `dispatch_object_create`:

- `block`
- `data`: Data blocks
- `group`: Group of blocks
- `io`: Async I/O requests
- `mach`: Mach ports
- `mach_msg`: Mach messages
- `pthread_root_queue`:A queue with a pthread thread pool and not workqueues
- `queue`
- `semaphore`
- `source`: Event source

## Objective-C

In Objetive-C there are different functions to send a block to be executed in parallel:

- [**dispatch_async**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1453057-dispatch_async): Submits a block for asynchronous execution on a dispatch queue and returns immediately.
- [**dispatch_sync**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1452870-dispatch_sync): Submits a block object for execution and returns after that block finishes executing.
- [**dispatch_once**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1447169-dispatch_once): Executes a block object only once for the lifetime of an application.
- [**dispatch_async_and_wait**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/3191901-dispatch_async_and_wait): Submits a work item for execution and returns only after it finishes executing. Unlike [**`dispatch_sync`**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1452870-dispatch_sync), this function respects all attributes of the queue when it executes the block.

These functions expect these parameters: [**`dispatch_queue_t`**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatch_queue_t) **`queue,`** [**`dispatch_block_t`**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatch_block_t) **`block`**

This is the **struct of a Block**:

```c
struct Block {
   void *isa; // NSConcreteStackBlock,...
   int flags;
   int reserved;
   void *invoke;
   struct BlockDescriptor *descriptor;
   // captured variables go here
};
```

And this is an example to use **parallelism** with **`dispatch_async`**:

```objectivec
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

// Define a block
void (^backgroundTask)(void) = ^{
    // Code to be executed in the background
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        NSLog(@"Background task %d", i);
        sleep(1);  // Simulate a long-running task
    }
};

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        // Create a dispatch queue
        dispatch_queue_t backgroundQueue = dispatch_queue_create("com.example.backgroundQueue", NULL);

        // Submit the block to the queue for asynchronous execution
        dispatch_async(backgroundQueue, backgroundTask);

        // Continue with other work on the main queue or thread
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            NSLog(@"Main task %d", i);
            sleep(1);  // Simulate a long-running task
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Swift

**`libswiftDispatch`** is a library that provides **Swift bindings** to the Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) framework which is originally written in C.\
The **`libswiftDispatch`** library wraps the C GCD APIs in a more Swift-friendly interface, making it easier and more intuitive for Swift developers to work with GCD.

- **`DispatchQueue.global().sync{ ... }`**
- **`DispatchQueue.global().async{ ... }`**
- **`let onceToken = DispatchOnce(); onceToken.perform { ... }`**
- **`async await`**
  - **`var (data, response) = await URLSession.shared.data(from: URL(string: "https://api.example.com/getData"))`**

**Code example**:

```swift
import Foundation

// Define a closure (the Swift equivalent of a block)
let backgroundTask: () -> Void = {
    for i in 0..<10 {
        print("Background task \(i)")
        sleep(1)  // Simulate a long-running task
    }
}

// Entry point
autoreleasepool {
    // Create a dispatch queue
    let backgroundQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.backgroundQueue")

    // Submit the closure to the queue for asynchronous execution
    backgroundQueue.async(execute: backgroundTask)

    // Continue with other work on the main queue
    for i in 0..<10 {
        print("Main task \(i)")
        sleep(1)  // Simulate a long-running task
    }
}
```

## Frida

The following Frida script can be used to **hook into several `dispatch`** functions and extract the queue name, the backtrace and the block: [**https://github.com/seemoo-lab/frida-scripts/blob/main/scripts/libdispatch.js**](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/frida-scripts/blob/main/scripts/libdispatch.js)

```bash
frida -U <prog_name> -l libdispatch.js

dispatch_sync
Calling queue: com.apple.UIKit._UIReusePool.reuseSetAccess
Callback function: 0x19e3a6488 UIKitCore!__26-[_UIReusePool addObject:]_block_invoke
Backtrace:
0x19e3a6460 UIKitCore!-[_UIReusePool addObject:]
0x19e3a5db8 UIKitCore!-[UIGraphicsRenderer _enqueueContextForReuse:]
0x19e3a57fc UIKitCore!+[UIGraphicsRenderer _destroyCGContext:withRenderer:]
[...]
```

## Ghidra

Currently Ghidra doesn't understand neither the ObjectiveC **`dispatch_block_t`** structure, neither the **`swift_dispatch_block`** one.

So if you want it to understand them, you could just **declare them**:

<figure><img src="../../images/image (1160).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../images/image (1162).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../images/image (1163).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Then, find a place in the code where they are **used**:

> [!TIP]
> Note all of references made to "block" to understand how you could figure out that the struct is being used.

<figure><img src="../../images/image (1164).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Right click on the variable -> Retype Variable and select in this case **`swift_dispatch_block`**:

<figure><img src="../../images/image (1165).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Ghidra will automatically rewrite everything:
