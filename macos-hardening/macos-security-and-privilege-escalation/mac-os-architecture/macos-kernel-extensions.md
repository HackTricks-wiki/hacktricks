## Basic Information

Kernel extensions (Kexts) are **packages** with a **`.kext`** extension that are **loaded directly into the macOS kernel space**, providing additional functionality to the main operating system.

### Requirements

Obviously, this is so powerful that it is **complicated to load a kernel extension**. These are the **requirements** that a kernel extension must meet to be loaded:

* When **entering recovery mode**, kernel **extensions must be allowed** to be loaded:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (327).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* The kernel extension must be **signed with a kernel code signing certificate**, which can only be **granted by Apple**. Who will review in detail the company and the reasons why it is needed.
* The kernel extension must also be **notarized**, Apple will be able to check it for malware.
* Then, the **root** user is the one who can **load the kernel extension** and the files inside the package must **belong to root**.
* During the upload process, the package must be prepared in a **protected non-root location**: `/Library/StagedExtensions` (requires the `com.apple.rootless.storage.KernelExtensionManagement` grant).
* Finally, when attempting to load it, the user will [**receive a confirmation request**](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2459/\_index.html) and, if accepted, the computer must be **restarted** to load it.

### Loading process

In Catalina it was like this: It is interesting to note that the **verification** process occurs in **userland**. However, only applications with the **`com.apple.private.security.kext-management`** grant can **request the kernel to load an extension**: `kextcache`, `kextload`, `kextutil`, `kextd`, `syspolicyd`

1. **`kextutil`** cli **starts** the **verification** process for loading an extension
   * It will talk to **`kextd`** by sending using a **Mach service**.
2. **`kextd`** will check several things, such as the **signature**
   * It will talk to **`syspolicyd`** to **check** if the extension can be **loaded**.
3. **`syspolicyd`** will **prompt** the **user** if the extension has not been previously loaded.
   * **`syspolicyd`** will report the result to **`kextd`**
4. **`kextd`** will finally be able to **tell the kernel to load** the extension

If **`kextd`** is not available, **`kextutil`** can perform the same checks.

### Enumeration (loaded kexts)

```bash
# Get loaded kernel extensions
kextstat

# Get dependencies of the kext number 22
kextstat | grep " 22 " | cut -c2-5,50- | cut -d '(' -f1
```

## Kernelcache

{% hint style="danger" %}
Even though the kernel extensions are expected to be in `/System/Library/Extensions/`, if you go to this folder you **won't find any binary**. This is because of the **kernelcache** and in order to reverse one `.kext` you need to find a way to obtain it.
{% endhint %}

The **kernelcache** is a **pre-compiled and pre-linked version of the XNU kernel**, along with essential device **drivers** and **kernel extensions**. It's stored in a **compressed** format and gets decompressed into memory during the boot-up process. The kernelcache facilitates a **faster boot time** by having a ready-to-run version of the kernel and crucial drivers available, reducing the time and resources that would otherwise be spent on dynamically loading and linking these components at boot time.

### Local Kerlnelcache

In iOS it's located in **`/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kernelcaches/kernelcache`** in macOS you can find it with: **`find / -name "kernelcache" 2>/dev/null`** \
In my case in macOS I found it in:

* `/System/Volumes/Preboot/1BAEB4B5-180B-4C46-BD53-51152B7D92DA/boot/DAD35E7BC0CDA79634C20BD1BD80678DFB510B2AAD3D25C1228BB34BCD0A711529D3D571C93E29E1D0C1264750FA043F/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kernelcaches/kernelcache`

#### IMG4

The IMG4 file format is a container format used by Apple in its iOS and macOS devices for securely **storing and verifying firmware** components (like **kernelcache**). The IMG4 format includes a header and several tags which encapsulate different pieces of data including the actual payload (like a kernel or bootloader), a signature, and a set of manifest properties. The format supports cryptographic verification, allowing the device to confirm the authenticity and integrity of the firmware component before executing it.

It's usually composed of the following components:

* **Payload (IM4P)**:
  * Often compressed (LZFSE4, LZSS, …)
  * Optionally encrypted
* **Manifest (IM4M)**:
  * Contains Signature
  * Additional Key/Value dictionary
* **Restore Info (IM4R)**:
  * Also known as APNonce
  * Prevents replaying of some updates
  * OPTIONAL: Usually this isn't found

Decompress the Kernelcache:

```bash
# img4tool (https://github.com/tihmstar/img4tool
img4tool -e kernelcache.release.iphone14 -o kernelcache.release.iphone14.e

# pyimg4 (https://github.com/m1stadev/PyIMG4)
pyimg4 im4p extract -i kernelcache.release.iphone14 -o kernelcache.release.iphone14.e
```

### Download&#x20;

* [**KernelDebugKit Github**](https://github.com/dortania/KdkSupportPkg/releases)

In [https://github.com/dortania/KdkSupportPkg/releases](https://github.com/dortania/KdkSupportPkg/releases) it's possible to find all the kernel debug kits. You can download it, mount it, open it with [Suspicious Package](https://www.mothersruin.com/software/SuspiciousPackage/get.html) tool, access the **`.kext`** folder and **extract it**.

Check it for symbols with:

```bash
nm -a ~/Downloads/Sandbox.kext/Contents/MacOS/Sandbox | wc -l
```

* [**theapplewiki.com**](https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/Firmware/Mac/14.x)**,** [**ipsw.me**](https://ipsw.me/)**,** [**theiphonewiki.com**](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/)

Sometime Apple releases **kernelcache** with **symbols**. You can download some firmwares with symbols by following links on those pages. The firmwares will contain the **kernelcache** among other files.

To **extract** the files start by changing the extension from `.ipsw` to `.zip` and **unzip** it.

After extracting the firmware you will get a file like: **`kernelcache.release.iphone14`**. It's in **IMG4** format, you can extract the interesting info with:

[**pyimg4**](https://github.com/m1stadev/PyIMG4)**:**

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
pyimg4 im4p extract -i kernelcache.release.iphone14 -o kernelcache.release.iphone14.e
```
{% endcode %}

[**img4tool**](https://github.com/tihmstar/img4tool)**:**

```bash
img4tool -e kernelcache.release.iphone14 -o kernelcache.release.iphone14.e
```

### Inspecting kernelcache

Check if the kernelcache has symbols with

```bash
nm -a kernelcache.release.iphone14.e | wc -l
```

With this we can now **extract all the extensions** or the **one you are interested in:**

```bash
# List all extensions
kextex -l kernelcache.release.iphone14.e
## Extract com.apple.security.sandbox
kextex -e com.apple.security.sandbox kernelcache.release.iphone14.e

# Extract all
kextex_all kernelcache.release.iphone14.e

# Check the extension for symbols
nm -a binaries/com.apple.security.sandbox | wc -l
```
