# Burp Suite Configuration for iOS

## Burp Cert Installation in physical iOS

You can install [**Burp Mobile Assistant**](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/mobile-assistant/installing) **for help installing the Burp Certificate, configure the proxy and perform SSL Pinning.**  
Or you can manually follow the next steps:

* Configure **Burp** as the iPhone **proxy in** _**Settings**_ **--&gt;** _**Wifi**_ **--&gt;** _**Click the network**_ **--&gt;** _**Proxy**_
* Access `http://burp` and download the certificate
* Access _**Setting**_ --&gt; _**Profile Downloaded**_ and **Install** it \(you will be asked your code\)
* Access _**Settings**_ --&gt; _**General**_ --&gt; _**About**_ --&gt; _**Certificate Trust Settings**_ and enable PortSwigger CA

### Setting up an Interception Proxy via localhost

Setting up Burp to proxy your traffic is pretty straightforward. We assume that both your iOS device and host computer are connected to a Wi-Fi network that permits client-to-client traffic. If client-to-client traffic is not permitted, you can use usbmuxd to connect to Burp via USB.

PortSwigger provides a good [tutorial on setting up an iOS device to work with Burp](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1841108-configuring-an-ios-device-to-work-with-burp) and a [tutorial on installing Burp's CA certificate to an iOS device](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1841109-installing-burp-s-ca-certificate-in-an-ios-device).

#### Using Burp via USB on a Jailbroken Device

When doing dynamic analysis, it's interesting to use the SSH connection to route our traffic to Burp that is running on our computer. Let's get started:

First we need to use **iproxy** to make SSH from iOS available on localhost.

```bash
$ iproxy 2222 22
waiting for connection
```

The next step is to make a remote port forwarding of port 8080 on the iOS device to the localhost interface on our computer to port 8080.

```bash
ssh -R 8080:localhost:8080 root@localhost -p 2222
```

You should now be able to reach Burp on your iOS device. Open Safari on iOS and go to **127.0.0.1:8080** and you should see the Burp Suite Page. This would also be a good time to [install the CA certificate](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1841109-installing-burp-s-ca-certificate-in-an-ios-device) of Burp on your iOS device.

The last step would be to set the proxy globally on your iOS device:

1. Go to **Settings** -&gt; **Wi-Fi**
2. Connect to _any_ Wi-Fi \(you can literally connect to any Wi-Fi as the traffic for port 80 and 443 will be routed through USB, as we are just using the Proxy Setting for the Wi-Fi so we can set a global Proxy\)
3. Once connected click on the small blue icon on the right side of the connect Wi-Fi
4. Configure your Proxy by selecting **Manual**
5. Type in 127.0.0.1 as **Server**
6. Type in 8080 as **Port**

### Full Network Monitoring/Sniffing

If you need to **monitor something different from HTTP communications** you can sniff all the device traffic with **wireshark**.  
You can remotely sniff all traffic in real-time on iOS by [creating a Remote Virtual Interface](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9555403/capturing-mobile-phone-traffic-on-wireshark/33175819#33175819) for your iOS device. First make sure you have **Wireshark** **installed** on your macOS host computer.

1. **Connect** your iOS device to your macOS host computer via USB.
2. You would need to know the **UDID of your iOS device**, before you can start sniffing. Open the Terminal on macOS and enter the following command, filling in the UDID of your iOS device.

```bash
$ rvictl -s <UDID>
Starting device <UDID> [SUCCEEDED] with interface rvi0
```

1. Launch **Wireshark** and select "**rvi0**" as the capture interface.
2. Filter the traffic with Capture Filters in Wireshark to display what you want to monitor \(for example, all HTTP traffic sent/received via the IP address 192.168.1.1\).

```text
ip.addr == 192.168.1.1 && http
```

The documentation of Wireshark offers many examples for [Capture Filters](https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureFilters) that should help you to filter the traffic to get the information you want.

## Burp Cert Installation in Simulator

* **Export Burp Certificate**

In _Proxy_ --&gt; _Options_ --&gt; _Export CA certificate_ --&gt; _Certificate in DER format_

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28457%29.png)

* **Drag and Drop** the certificate inside the Emulator
* **Inside the emulator** go to _Settings_ --&gt; _General_ --&gt; _Profile_ --&gt; _PortSwigger CA_, and **verify the certificate**
* **Inside the emulator** go to _Settings_ --&gt; _General_ --&gt; _About_ --&gt; _Certificate Trust Settings_, and **enable PortSwigger CA**

**Congrats, you have successfully configured the Burp CA Certificate in the iOS simulator**

{% hint style="info" %}
**The iOS simulator will use the proxy configurations of the MacOS.**
{% endhint %}

### MacOS Proxy Configuration

Steps to configure Burp as proxy:

* Go to _System Preferences_ --&gt; _Network_ --&gt; _Advanced_
* In _Proxies_ tab mark _Web Proxy \(HTTP\)_ and _Secure Web Proxy \(HTTPS\)_
* In both options configure _127.0.0.1:8080_

* Click on _**Ok**_ and the in _**Apply**_
