# Cookie Bomb

A cookie bomb is basically the capability of **adding a large number of big cookies to a user** for a domain an its subdomains with the goal that the victim will always **send very big HTTP requests **to the server (due to the cookies) that the **server won't accept the request**. Therefore, this will cause a DoS over a user in that domains and subdomains.

A nice **example** can be seen in this write-up: [https://hackerone.com/reports/57356](https://hackerone.com/reports/57356)
