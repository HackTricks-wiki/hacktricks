## Understanding Unicode and Normalization

Unicode normalization is a process that ensures different binary representations of characters are standardized to the same binary value. This process is crucial in dealing with strings in programming and data processing. The Unicode standard defines two types of character equivalence:

1. **Canonical Equivalence**: Characters are considered canonically equivalent if they have the same appearance and meaning when printed or displayed.
2. **Compatibility Equivalence**: A weaker form of equivalence where characters may represent the same abstract character but can be displayed differently.

There are **four Unicode normalization algorithms**: NFC, NFD, NFKC, and NFKD. Each algorithm employs canonical and compatibility normalization techniques differently. For a more in-depth understanding, you can explore these techniques on [Unicode.org](https://unicode.org/).

### Key Points on Unicode Encoding

Understanding Unicode encoding is pivotal, especially when dealing with interoperability issues among different systems or languages. Here are the main points:

* **Code Points and Characters**: In Unicode, each character or symbol is assigned a numerical value known as a "code point".
* **Bytes Representation**: The code point (or character) is represented by one or more bytes in memory. For instance, LATIN-1 characters (common in English-speaking countries) are represented using one byte. However, languages with a larger set of characters need more bytes for representation.
* **Encoding**: This term refers to how characters are transformed into a series of bytes. UTF-8 is a prevalent encoding standard where ASCII characters are represented using one byte, and up to four bytes for other characters.
* **Processing Data**: Systems processing data must be aware of the encoding used to correctly convert the byte stream into characters.
* **Variants of UTF**: Besides UTF-8, there are other encoding standards like UTF-16 (using a minimum of 2 bytes, up to 4) and UTF-32 (using 4 bytes for all characters).

It's crucial to comprehend these concepts to effectively handle and mitigate potential issues arising from Unicode's complexity and its various encoding methods.

An example of how Unicode normalise two different bytes representing the same character:

```python
unicodedata.normalize("NFKD","chloe\u0301") == unicodedata.normalize("NFKD", "chlo\u00e9")
```

**A list of Unicode equivalent characters can be found here:** [https://appcheck-ng.com/wp-content/uploads/unicode\_normalization.html](https://appcheck-ng.com/wp-content/uploads/unicode\_normalization.html) and [https://0xacb.com/normalization\_table](https://0xacb.com/normalization\_table)

### Discovering

If you can find inside a webapp a value that is being echoed back, you could try to send **‘KELVIN SIGN’ (U+0212A)** which **normalises to "K"** (you can send it as `%e2%84%aa`). **If a "K" is echoed back**, then, some kind of **Unicode normalisation** is being performed.

Other **example**: `%F0%9D%95%83%E2%85%87%F0%9D%99%A4%F0%9D%93%83%E2%85%88%F0%9D%94%B0%F0%9D%94%A5%F0%9D%99%96%F0%9D%93%83` after **unicode** is `Leonishan`.

## **Vulnerable Examples**

### **SQL Injection filter bypass**

Imagine a web page that is using the character `'` to create SQL queries with the user input. This web, as a security measure, **deletes** all occurrences of the character **`'`** from the user input, but **after that deletion** and **before the creation** of the query, it **normalises** using **Unicode** the input of the user.

Then, a malicious user could insert a different Unicode character equivalent to `' (0x27)` like `%ef%bc%87` , when the input gets normalised, a single quote is created and a **SQLInjection vulnerability** appears:

**Some interesting Unicode characters**

* `o` -- %e1%b4%bc
* `r` -- %e1%b4%bf
* `1` -- %c2%b9
* `=` -- %e2%81%bc
* `/` -- %ef%bc%8f
* `-`-- %ef%b9%a3
* `#`-- %ef%b9%9f
* `*`-- %ef%b9%a1
* `'` -- %ef%bc%87
* `"` -- %ef%bc%82
* `|` -- %ef%bd%9c

### XSS (Cross Site Scripting)

You could use one of the following characters to trick the webapp and exploit a XSS:

![https://appcheck-ng.com/unicode-normalization-vulnerabilities-the-special-k-polyglot/](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (312) (2).png>)

Notice that for example the first Unicode character purposed can be sent as: `%e2%89%ae` or as `%u226e`

### Fuzzing Regexes

When the backend is **checking user input with a regex**, it might be possible that the **input** is being **normalized** for the **regex** but **not** for where it's being **used**. For example, in an Open Redirect or SSRF the regex might be **normalizing the sent UR**L but then **accessing it as is**.

The tool [**recollapse**](https://github.com/0xacb/recollapse) \*\*\*\* allows to **generate variation of the input** to fuzz the backend. Fore more info check the **github** and this [**post**](https://0xacb.com/2022/11/21/recollapse/).
