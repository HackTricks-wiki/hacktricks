# Unicode Normalization vulnerability

## Background

Normalization ensures two strings that may use a different binary representation for their characters have the same binary value after normalization.

There are two overall types of equivalence between characters, “**Canonical Equivalence**” and “**Compatibility Equivalence**”:\
**Canonical Equivalent** characters are assumed to have the same appearance and meaning when printed or displayed. **Compatibility Equivalence** is a weaker equivalence, in that two values may represent the same abstract character but can be displayed differently. There are **4 Normalization algorithms** defined by the **Unicode **standard; **NFC, NFD, NFKD and NFKD**, each applies Canonical and Compatibility normalization techniques in a different way. You can read more on the different techniques at Unicode.org.

### Unicode Encoding

Although Unicode was in part designed to solve interoperability issues, the evolution of the standard, the need to support legacy systems and different encoding methods can still pose a challenge.\
Before we delve into Unicode attacks, the following are the main points to understand about Unicode:

* Each character or symbol is mapped to a numerical value which is referred to as a “code point”.
* The code point value (and therefore the character itself) is represented by 1 or more bytes in memory. LATIN-1 characters like those used in English speaking countries can be represented using 1 byte. Other languages have more characters and need more bytes to represent all the different code points (also since they can’t use the ones already taken by LATIN-1).
* The term “encoding” means the method in which characters are represented as a series of bytes. The most common encoding standard is UTF-8, using this encoding scheme ASCII characters can be represented using 1 byte or up to 4 bytes for other characters.
* When a system processes data it needs to know the encoding used to convert the stream of bytes to characters.
* Though UTF-8 is the most common, there are similar encoding standards named UTF-16 and UTF-32, the difference between each is the number of bytes used to represent each character. i.e. UTF-16 uses a minimum of 2 bytes (but up to 4) and UTF-32 using 4 bytes for all characters.

An example of how Unicode normalise two different bytes representing the same character:

### Discovering

If you can find inside a webapp a value that is being echoed back, you could try to send** ‘KELVIN SIGN’ (U+0212A)** which **normalises to "K" **(you can send it as `%e2%84%aa`). **If a "K" is echoed back**, then, some kind of **Unicode normalisation **is being performed.

Other **example**: `%F0%9D%95%83%E2%85%87%F0%9D%99%A4%F0%9D%93%83%E2%85%88%F0%9D%94%B0%F0%9D%94%A5%F0%9D%99%96%F0%9D%93%83` after **unicode **is `Leonishan`.

## **Vulnerable Examples**

### **SQL Injection filter bypass**

Imagine a web page that is using the character `'` to create SQL queries with the user input. This web, as a security measure, **deletes **all occurrences of the character **`'`** from the user input, but **after that deletion** and **before the creation **of the query, it **normalises **using **Unicode **the input of the user.

Then, a malicious user could insert a different Unicode character equivalent to` ' (0x27)` like `%ef%bc%87` , when the input gets normalised, a single quote is created and a **SQLInjection vulnerability** appears:

#### Some interesting Unicode characters

* `o` -- %e1%b4%bc
* `r` -- %e1%b4%bf
* `1` -- %c2%b9
* `=` -- %e2%81%bc
* `/` -- %ef%bc%8f
* `-`--  %ef%b9%a3
* `#`--  %ef%b9%9f
* `*`--  %ef%b9%a1
* `'` -- %ef%bc%87
* `"` -- %ef%bc%82
* `|` -- %ef%bd%9c

```

### XSS (Cross Site Scripting)

You could use one of the following characters to trick the webapp and exploit a XSS:

Notice that for example the first Unicode character purposed can be sent as: `%e2%89%ae` or as `%u226e`
