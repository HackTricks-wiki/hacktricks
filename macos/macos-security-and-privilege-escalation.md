# MacOS Security & Privilege Escalation

First of all, please note that **most of the tricks about privilege escalation affecting Linux/Unix will affect also MacOS** machines. So see:

{% page-ref page="../linux-unix/privilege-escalation/" %}

## Security Restrictions

### Gatekeeper

_Gatekeeper_ is designed to ensure that, by default, **only trusted software runs on a user’s Mac**. Gatekeeper is used when a user **downloads** and **opens** an app, a plug-in or an installer package from outside the App Store. Gatekeeper verifies that the **software is from an identified developer**, is notarised by Apple to be **free of known malicious content**, and **hasn’t been altered**. Gatekeeper also **requests user approval** before opening downloaded software for the first time to make sure the user hasn’t been tricked into running executable code they believed to simply be a data file.

Gatekeeper builds upon **File Quarantine.**  
Upon download of an application, a particular **extended file attribute** \("quarantine flag"\) can be **added** to the **downloaded** **file**. This attribute **is added by the application that downloads the file**, such as a **web** **browser** or email client, but is not usually added by others like common BitTorrent client software.  
When a user executes a "quarentined" file, **Gatekeeper** is the one that **performs the mentioned actions** to allow the execution of the file.

It's possible to **check it's status and enable/disable** \(root required\) with:

```bash
spctl --status
assessments enabled

spctl --enable
spctl --disable
#You can also allow nee identifies to execute code using the binary "spctl"
```

You can also **find if a file has the quarantine extended attribute** with:

```bash
xattr portada.png
com.apple.macl
com.apple.quarantine
```

Check the **value** of the **extended** **attributes** with:

```bash
xattr -l portada.png
com.apple.macl:
00000000  03 00 53 DA 55 1B AE 4C 4E 88 9D CA B7 5C 50 F3  |..S.U..LN.....P.|
00000010  16 94 03 00 27 63 64 97 98 FB 4F 02 84 F3 D0 DB  |....'cd...O.....|
00000020  89 53 C3 FC 03 00 27 63 64 97 98 FB 4F 02 84 F3  |.S....'cd...O...|
00000030  D0 DB 89 53 C3 FC 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |...S............|
00000040  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                          |........|
00000048
com.apple.quarantine: 0081;607842eb;Brave;F643CD5F-6071-46AB-83AB-390BA944DEC5
```

And **remove** that attribute with:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine portada.png
#You can also remove this attribute from every file with
find . -iname '*' -print0 | xargs -0 xattr -d com.apple.quarantine
```

And find all the quarantined files with:

```bash
find / -exec ls -ld {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep -E "[x\-]@ " | awk '{printf $9; printf "\n"}' | xargs -I {} xattr -lv {} | grep "com.apple.quarantine"
```

## Common users

* **Daemon**: User reserved for system daemons
* **Guest**: Account for guests with very strict permissions
* **Nobody**: Processes are executed with this user when minimal permissions are required
* **Root**

## **File ACLs**

When the file contains ACLs you will **find a "+" when listing the permissions like in**:

```bash
ls -ld Movies
drwx------+   7 username  staff     224 15 Apr 19:42 Movies
```

You can **read the ACLs** of the file with:

```bash
ls -lde Movies
drwx------+ 7 username  staff  224 15 Apr 19:42 Movies
 0: group:everyone deny delete
```

You can find **all the files with ACLs** with \(this is veeery slow\):

```bash
ls -RAle / 2>/dev/null | grep -E -B1 "\d: "
```

## Resource Forks or MacOS ADS

This is a way to obtain **Alternate Data Streams in MacOS** machines. You can save content inside an extended attribute called **com.apple.ResourceFork** inside a file by saving it in **file/..namedfork/rsrc**.

```bash
echo "Hello" > a.txt
echo "Hello Mac ADS" > a.txt/..namedfork/rsrc

xattr -l a.txt #Read extended attributes
com.apple.ResourceFork: Hello Mac ADS

ls -l a.txt #The file length is still q
-rw-r--r--@ 1 username  wheel  6 17 Jul 01:15 a.txt
```

You can **find all the files containing this extended attribute** with:

```bash
find / -type f -exec ls -ld {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep -E "[x\-]@ " | awk '{printf $9; printf "\n"}' | xargs -I {} xattr -lv {} | grep "com.apple.ResourceFork"
```

## OS X Specific Extensions

* **`.dmg`**: Apple Disk Image files are very frequent for installers.
* **`.kext`**: It must follow a specific structure and it's the OS X version of a driver.
* **`.plist`**: Also known as property list stores information in XML or binary format.
  * Can be XML or binary. Binary ones can be read with:
    * `defaults read config.plist`
    * `/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c print config.plsit`
    * `plutil -p config.plist`
* **`.app`**: Apple applications that follows  directory structure.
* **`.dylib`**: Dynamic libraries \(like Windows DLL files\)
* **`.pkg`**: Are the same as xar \(eXtensible Archive format\). The installer command can be use to install the contents of these files.

## File hierarchy layout

* **/Applications**: The installed apps should be here. All the users will be able to access them.
* **/bin**: Command line binaries
* **/cores**: If exists, it's used to store core dumps
* **/dev**: Everything is treated as a file so you may see hardware devices stored here.
* **/etc**: Configuration files
* **/Library**: A lot of subdirectories and files related to preferences, caches and logs can be found here. A Library folder exists in root and on each user's directory.
* **/private**: Undocumented but a lot of the mentioned folders are symbolic links to the private directory.
* **/sbin**: Essential system binaries \(related to administration\)
* **/System**: File fo making OS X run. You should find mostly only Apple specific files here \(not third party\).
* **/tmp**: Files are deleted after 3 days \(it's a soft link to /private/tmp\)
* **/Users**: Home directory for users.
* **/usr**: Config and system binaries
* **/var**: Log files
* **/Volumes**: The mounted drives will apear here.
* **/.vol**: Running `stat a.txt` you obtain something like `16777223 7545753 -rw-r--r-- 1 username wheel ...` where the first number is the id number of the volume where the file exists and the second one is the inode number. You can access the content of this file through /.vol/ with that information running  `cat /.vol/16777223/7545753`

### Special MacOS files and folders

* **`.DS_Store`**: This file is on each directory, it saves the attributes and customisations of the directory.
* **`.Spotlight-V100`**: This folder appears on the root directory of every volume on the system.
* **`.metadata_never_index`**: If this file is at the root of a volume Spotlight won't index that volume.
* **`<name>.noindex`**: Files and folder with this extension won't be indexed by Spotlight.
* **`$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV`**2: Contains information about downloaded files, like the URL from where they were downloaded.
* **`/var/log/system.log`**: Main log of OSX systems. com.apple.syslogd.plist is responsible for the execution of syslogging \(you can check if it's disabled looking for "com.apple.syslogd" in `launchctl list`.
* **`/private/var/log/asl/*.asl`**: These are the Apple System Logs which may contain interesting information.
* **`$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.recentitems.plist`**: Stores recently accessed files and applications through "Finder".
* **`$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plsit`**: Stores items to launch upon system startup
* **`$HOME/Library/Logs/DiskUtility.log`**: Log file for thee DiskUtility App \(info about drives, including USBs\)
* **`/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist`**: Data about wireless access points.
* **`/private/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist`**: List of daemons deactivated.
* **`/private/etc/kcpassword`**: If autologin is enabled this file will contain the users login password XORed with a key.

## Auto Start Extensibility Point \(ASEP\)

An **ASEP** is a location on the system that could lead to the **execution** of a binary **without** **user** **interaction**. The main ones used in OS X take the form of plists.

### Launchd

**`launchd`** is the **first** **process** executed by OX S kernel at startup and the last one to finish at shut down. It should always have the **PID 1**. This process will **read and execute** the configurations indicated in the **ASEP** **plists** in:

* `/Library/LaunchAgents`: Per-user agents installed by the admin
* `/Library/LaunchDaemons`: System-wide daemons installed by the admin
* `/System/Library/LaunchAgents`: Per-user agents provided by Apple.
* `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons`: System-wide daemons provided by Apple.

When a user logs in the plists located in `/Users/$USER/Library/LaunchAgents` are started with the **logged users permissions**.

The **main difference between agents and daemons is that agents are loaded when the user logs in and the daemons are loaded at system startup** \(as there are services like ssh that needs to be executed before any user access the system\). Also agents may use GUI while daemons need to run in the background.

```markup
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
        <string>com.apple.someidentifier</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/Users/username/malware</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key><true/> <!--Execute at system startup-->
    <key>StartInterval</key>
    <integer>800</integer> <!--Execute each 800s-->
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <dict>
        <key>SuccessfulExit</key></false> <!--Re-execute if exit unsuccessful-->
        <!--If previous is true, then re-execute in successful exit-->
    </dict>
</dict>
</plist>
```

There are cases where an **agent needs to be executed before the user logins**, these are called **PreLoginAgents**. For example, this is useful to provide assistive technology at login. They can be found also in `/Library/LaunchAgents`\(see [**here**](https://github.com/HelmutJ/CocoaSampleCode/tree/master/PreLoginAgents) an example\).

{% hint style="info" %}
New Daemons or Agents config files will be **loaded after next reboot or using** `launchctl load <target.plist>` It's **also possible to load .plist files without that extension** with `launchctl -F <file>` \(however those plist files won't be automatically loaded after reboot\).  
It's also possible to **unload** with `launchctl unload <target.plist>` \(the process pointed by it will be terminated\),

To **ensure** that there isn't **anything** \(like an override\) **preventing** an **Agent** or **Daemon** **from** **running** run: `sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemos/com.apple.smdb.plist`
{% endhint %}

List all the agents and daemons loaded by the current user:

```bash
launchctl list
```

### Cron

List the cron jobs of the **current user** with:

```bash
crontab -l
```

You can also see all the cron jobs of the users in **`/usr/lib/cron/tabs/`** \(needs root\).

### kext

In order to install a KEXT as a startup item, it needs to be **installed in one of the following locations**:

* `/System/Library/Extensions`
  * KEXT files built into the OS X operating system.
* `/Library/Extensions`
  * KEXT files installed by 3rd party software

You can list currently loaded kext files with:

```bash
kextstat #List loaded kext
kextload /path/to/kext.kext #Load a new one based on path
kextload -b com.apple.driver.ExampleBundle #Load a new one based on path
kextunload /path/to/kext.kext
kextunload -b com.apple.driver.ExampleBundle
```

### **Login Items**

In System Preferences -&gt; Users & Groups -&gt; **Login Items** you can find  **items to be executed when the user logs in**.  
It it's possible to list them, add and remove from the command line:

```bash
#List all items:
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to get the name of every login item'

#Add an item:
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to make login item at end with properties {path:"/path/to/itemname", hidden:false}' 

#Remove an item:
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to delete login item "itemname"' 

```

### At

“At tasks” are used to **schedule tasks at specific times**.  
These tasks differ from cron in that **they are one time tasks** t**hat get removed after executing**. However, they will **survive a system restart** so they can’t be ruled out as a potential threat.

By **default** they are **disabled** but the **root** user can **enable** **them** with:

```bash
sudo launchctl load -F /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.atrun.plist
```

This will create a file at 13:37:

```bash
echo hello > /tmp/hello | at 1337
```

If AT tasks aren't enabled the created tasks won't be executed.

### Login/Logout Hooks

They are deprecated but can be used to execute commands when a user logs in.

```bash
cat > $HOME/hook.sh << EOF
#!/bin/bash
echo 'My is: \`id\`' > /tmp/login_id.txt
EOF
chmod +x $HOME/hook.sh
defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /Users/$USER/hook.sh
```

This setting is stored in `/Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist`

```bash
defaults read /Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist
{
    LoginHook = "/Users/username/hook.sh";
    MiniBuddyLaunch = 0;
    TALLogoutReason = "Shut Down";
    TALLogoutSavesState = 0;
    oneTimeSSMigrationComplete = 1;
}
```

To delete it:

```bash
defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook
```

In the previous example we have created and deleted a **LoginHook**, it's also possible to create a **LogoutHook**.

The root user one is stored in `/private/var/root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist`

### Startup Items

This is deprecated, so nothing should be found in the following directories.

A **StartupItem** is a **directory** that gets **placed** in one of these two folders. `/Library/StartupItems/` or `/System/Library/StartupItems/`

After placing a new directory in one of these two locations, **two more items** need to be placed inside that directory. These two items are a **rc script** **and a plist** that holds a few settings. This plist must be called “**StartupParameters.plist**”.

{% code title="StartupParameters.plist" %}
```markup
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Description</key>
        <string>This is a description of this service</string>
    <key>OrderPreference</key>
        <string>None</string> <!--Other req services to execute before this -->
    <key>Provides</key>
    <array>
        <string>superservicename</string> <!--Name of the services provided by this file -->
    </array>
</dict>
</plist>
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="superservicename" %}
```bash
#!/bin/sh
. /etc/rc.common

StartService(){
    touch /tmp/superservicestarted
}

StopService(){
    rm /tmp/superservicestarted
}

RestartService(){
    echo "Restarting"
}

RunService "$1"
```
{% endcode %}

### /etc/rc.common

It's also possible to place here **commands that will be executed at startup.** Example os regular rc.common script:

```bash
