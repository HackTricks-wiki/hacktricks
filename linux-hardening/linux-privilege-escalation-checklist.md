### **Best tool to look for Linux local privilege escalation vectors:** [**LinPEAS**](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS)

### [System Information](privilege-escalation/#system-information)

* [ ] Get **OS information**
* [ ] Check the [**PATH**](privilege-escalation/#path), any **writable folder**?
* [ ] Check [**env variables**](privilege-escalation/#env-info), any sensitive detail?
* [ ] Search for [**kernel exploits**](privilege-escalation/#kernel-exploits) **using scripts** (DirtyCow?)
* [ ] **Check** if the [**sudo version** is vulnerable](privilege-escalation/#sudo-version)
* [ ] [**Dmesg** signature verification failed](privilege-escalation/#dmesg-signature-verification-failed)
* [ ] More system enum ([date, system stats, cpu info, printers](privilege-escalation/#more-system-enumeration))
* [ ] [Enumerate more defenses](privilege-escalation/#enumerate-possible-defenses)

### [Drives](privilege-escalation/#drives)

* [ ] **List mounted** drives
* [ ] **Any unmounted drive?**
* [ ] **Any creds in fstab?**

### [**Installed Software**](privilege-escalation/#installed-software)

* [ ] **Check for**[ **useful software**](privilege-escalation/#useful-software) **installed**
* [ ] **Check for** [**vulnerable software**](privilege-escalation/#vulnerable-software-installed) **installed**

### [Processes](privilege-escalation/#processes)

* [ ] Is any **unknown software running**?
* [ ] Is any software running with **more privileges than it should have**?
* [ ] Search for **exploits of running processes** (especially the version running).
* [ ] Can you **modify the binary** of any running process?
* [ ] **Monitor processes** and check if any interesting process is running frequently.
* [ ] Can you **read** some interesting **process memory** (where passwords could be saved)?

### [Scheduled/Cron jobs?](privilege-escalation/#scheduled-jobs)

* [ ] Is the [**PATH** ](privilege-escalation/#cron-path)being modified by some cron and you can **write** in it?
* [ ] Any [**wildcard** ](privilege-escalation/#cron-using-a-script-with-a-wildcard-wildcard-injection)in a cron job?
* [ ] Some [**modifiable script** ](privilege-escalation/#cron-script-overwriting-and-symlink)is being **executed** or is inside **modifiable folder**?
* [ ] Have you detected that some **script** could be being [**executed** very **frequently**](privilege-escalation/#frequent-cron-jobs)? (every 1, 2 or 5 minutes)

### [Services](privilege-escalation/#services)

* [ ] Any **writable .service** file?
* [ ] Any **writable binary** executed by a **service**?
* [ ] Any **writable folder in systemd PATH**?

### [Timers](privilege-escalation/#timers)

* [ ] Any **writable timer**?

### [Sockets](privilege-escalation/#sockets)

* [ ] Any **writable .socket** file?
* [ ] Can you **communicate with any socket**?
* [ ] **HTTP sockets** with interesting info?

### [D-Bus](privilege-escalation/#d-bus)

* [ ] Can you **communicate with any D-Bus**?

### [Network](privilege-escalation/#network)

* [ ] Enumerate the network to know where you are
* [ ] **Open ports you couldn't access before** getting a shell inside the machine?
* [ ] Can you **sniff traffic** using `tcpdump`?

### [Users](privilege-escalation/#users)

* [ ] Generic users/groups **enumeration**
* [ ] Do you have a **very big UID**? Is the **machine** **vulnerable**?
* [ ] Can you [**escalate privileges thanks to a group**](privilege-escalation/interesting-groups-linux-pe/) you belong to?
* [ ] **Clipboard** data?
* [ ] Password Policy?
* [ ] Try to **use** every **known password** that you have discovered previously to login **with each** possible **user**. Try to login also without a password.

### [Writable PATH](privilege-escalation/#writable-path-abuses)

* [ ] If you have **write privileges over some folder in PATH** you may be able to escalate privileges

### [SUDO and SUID commands](privilege-escalation/#sudo-and-suid)

* [ ] Can you execute **any command with sudo**? Can you use it to READ, WRITE or EXECUTE anything as root? ([**GTFOBins**](https://gtfobins.github.io))
* [ ] Is any **exploitable suid binary**? ([**GTFOBins**](https://gtfobins.github.io))
* [ ] Are [**sudo** commands **limited** by **path**? can you **bypass** the restrictions](privilege-escalation/#sudo-execution-bypassing-paths)?
