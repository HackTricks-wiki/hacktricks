Please, note that **most of the content of all the info related to \_Pentesting Printers**\_\*\* \*\* was taken **from** the **huge** and **amazing research** you can find on [**http://hacking-printers.net/**](http://hacking-printers.net). I tried to **summarise** that information here but you can always **go to the source to learn more about the topic**.

## Fundamentals

A schematic relationship regarding the encapsulation of printer languages is given below:\\

## Network printing protocols

**Sending data** to a printer device can be done by **USB/parallel cable** or over a **network**. This wiki focuses on network printing but most of the presented attacks can also be performed against local printers. There are various exotic protocols for network printing like Novell's [_NCP_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetWare\_Core\_Protocol) or [_AppleTalk_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleTalk). In the Windows world, _SMB/CIFS_ printer shares have become quite popular. Furthermore, some devices support printing over generic protocols such as _FTP_ or _HTTP_ file uploads. The **most common printing protocols** supported directly by **network** printers however are _**LPD**_**, \_IPP**_\*\*, and \*\*_**raw port 9100** \_ printing. **Network printing protocols can be attacked directly**, for example by exploiting a buffer overflow in the printer's LPD daemon. In many attack scenarios however, they only act as a **carrier/channel** to **deploy malicious Printer language code**. Note that a **network printer usually supports multiple protocols to ‘print’** a document which broadens the attack surface.

## Printer Control Languages

A job control language manages settings like output trays for the current print job. While it usually sits as an optional layer in-between the printing protocol and the page description language, functions may be overlapping. Examples of vendor-specific job control languages are [CPCA](http://www.undocprint.org/formats/printer\_control\_languages/cpca), [XJCL](http://www.undocprint.org/formats/printer\_control\_languages/xjcl), [EJL](http://www.undocprint.org/formats/printer\_control\_languages/ejl) and **PJL** – which is supported by a variety of printers and will be discussed below. In addition, **printer control and management languages** are designed to **affect** not only a single print job but the **device** as a **whole**. One approach to define a common standard for this task was [NPAP](http://www.undocprint.org/formats/printer\_control\_languages/npap). However, it has not established itself and is only supported by Lexmark. Other printer manufacturers instead use SNMP or its **PJL-based** metalanguage **PML**.

### PJL

The Printer Job Language (PJL) was originally introduced by HP but soon became a de facto standard for print job control. ‘PJL resides above other printer languages’ and can be used to change settings like paper tray or size. It must however be pointed out that **PJL is not limited to the current print job as some settings can be made permanent**. PJL can also be used to **change the printer's display or read/write files on the device**. There are many dialects as vendors tend to support only a subset of the commands listed in the PJL reference and instead prefer to add proprietary ones. **PJL is further used to set the file format of the actual print data to follow**. Without such explicit language switching, the printer has to identify the page description language based on magic numbers. Typical PJL commands to set the paper size and the number of copies before switching the interpreter to PostScript mode are shown below:

```
@PJL SET PAPER=A4
@PJL SET COPIES=10
@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE=POSTSCRIPT
```

Inside the [**page about port 9100 'raw port'**](../9100-pjl.md) you can find more information about **how to enumerate PJL**.

### PML

The **Printer Management Language** (PML) is a proprietary language to control **HP printers**. It basically **combines** the features of **SNMP** **with PJL**. Publicly available documentation has not been released, however parts of the standard were leaked by the [LPRng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPRng) project: the **PJL Passthrough to PML and SNMP User’s Guide** defines defines PML as ‘an object-oriented request-reply printer management protocol’ and gives an introduction to the basics of the syntax. PML is embedded within PJL and **can be used to read and set SNMP values on a printer device**. This is especially **interesting** if a **firewall blocks** access to **SNMP** services (161/udp). The use of PML within a print job retrieving the `hrDeviceDescr` value (OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.2.1.3, textual description of a device) is demonstrated below:

```
> @PJL DMINFO ASCIIHEX="000006030302010301"
< "8000000603030201030114106870204c617365724a65742034323530
```

The rear part of string responded by the printer, `6870204c617365724a65742034323530` is hexadecimal for `hp LaserJet 4250`. As can be seen, it is possible to **invoke** (a subset of) **SNMP** **commands over PJL via PML**. A security-sensitive use of PML is to [reset HP printers to factory defaults](./#factory-defaults) via ordinary print jobs, therefore removing protection mechanisms like user-set passwords.

### UEL

The Universal Exit Language (UEL) actually is **not a real job control ‘language’ but a single command used to terminate the current data stream**: the escape character (`\x1b`), followed by `%-12345X`. It was originally introduced with HP's PCL and is **supported by most modern laser printers**. A good practice of ‘printer drivers’ is to invoke the UEL at the beginning and at the end of each print job, so interpretation of the printer language is stopped/restarted and each job has its own, separate environment as shown below:

```
\x1b%-12345X
@PJL SET PAPER=A4
@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE=PCL
...
[PCL datastream]
...
\x1b%-12345X
```

Otherwise, for example PJL settings like paper media size or PostScript definitions set in one print job would influence the next job. **UEL can be handy to string together multiple jobs into a single file/datastream sent to the printer**. This can be used to fool **hardware page counters** or to switch the printing language in advances **cross-site printing attacks**.

## Page Description Languages

A **page description language** (PDL) specifies the **appearance of the actual document**. It must however be pointed out that some PDLs offer limited job control, so **a clear demarcation between page description and printer/job control language is not always possible**. The function of a ‘printer driver’ is to **translate** the **file** to be **printed** into a **PDL** that is **understood** by the printer model. Note that some low cost inkjet printers do not support any high level page description language at all. So called host-based or [GDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics\_Device\_Interface#GDI\_printers) printers only accept simple bitmap datastreams like [ZJS](http://www.undocprint.org/formats/page\_description\_languages/zjstream) while the actual rendering is done by the printer driver. There are various proprietary page description languages like Kyocera's [PRESCRIBE](http://www.undocprint.org/formats/page\_description\_languages/prescribe), [SPL](http://www.undocprint.org/formats/page\_description\_languages/spl), [XES](http://www.undocprint.org/formats/page\_description\_languages/xes), [CaPSL](http://www.undocprint.org/formats/page\_description\_languages/capsl), [RPCS](http://www.undocprint.org/formats/page\_description\_languages/rpcs), [ESC/P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESC/P) which is mostly used in dot matrix printers or [HP-GL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPGL) and [HP-GL/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPGL#HP-GL.2F2) which have been designed for plotters. Support for direct [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable\_Document\_Format) and [XPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open\_XML\_Paper\_Specification) printing is also common on newer printers. **The most common ‘standard’ page description languages however are PostScript and PCL.**

### PostScript (PS)

The term ‘page description’ may be misleading though, as **PostScript is capable of much more than just creating vector graphics**. PostScript is a stack-based, **Turing-complete** programming language consisting of almost 400 operators for arithmetics, stack and graphic manipulation and various data types such as arrays or dictionaries and was created by Adobe.\
Technically spoken, access to a PostScript interpreter can already be classified as **code execution** because any algorithmic function can theoretically be implemented in PostScript. Certainly, without access to the network stack or additional operating system libraries, possibilities are limited to arbitrary mathematical calculations like mining bitcoins. However, PostScript is capable of basic file system I/O to store frequently used code, graphics or font files.\
Originally designed as a feature, the dangers of such functionality **were limited** before printers got interconnected and risks were mainly discussed in the context of host-based PostScript interpreters. In this regard, Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) is also noteworthy as it can be included in other file formats to be interpreted on the host such as [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) documents. Like **PJL** and **PCL**, **PostScript** supports **bidirectional communication** been host and printer.\
Example PostScript code to echo Hello world to stdout is given below:

```
%!
(Hello world) print
```

Brother and Kyocera use their own PostScript clones: **Br-Script** and **KPDL**. Such flavours of the PostScript language are not 100% compatible, especially concerning security features like exiting the server loop. PostScript can be used for a variety of attacks such as [denial of service](http://hacking-printers.net/wiki/index.php/Denial\_of\_service) (for example, through infinite loops), print job [manipulation](http://hacking-printers.net/wiki/index.php/Print\_job\_manipulation) and [retention](http://hacking-printers.net/wiki/index.php/Print\_job\_retention) as well as gaining access to the printer's [file system](http://hacking-printers.net/wiki/index.php/File\_system\_access).

#### Exiting the server loop

Normally, each print job is encapsulated in its own, separate environment. One interesting feature of **PostScript** is that a program **can circumvent print job encapsulation** and alter the initial VM for subsequent jobs. To do so, it can use either startjob, a Level 2 feature:

```
true 0 startjob
```

or exitserver (available in all implementations that include a job server):

```
serverdict begin 0 exitserver
```

This capability is controlled by the StartJobPassword which defaults to `0` (compare credential disclosure). Since the job server loop is generally responsible for cleaning up the state of the interpreter between jobs, **any changes that are made outside the server loop will remain as part of the permanent state of the interpreter for all subsequent jobs**. In other words, a print job can access and alter further jobs. Bingo!

#### Operator redefinition

When a **PostScript** document **calls** an **operator**, the **first version found** on the dictionary stack is used. Operators usually reside in the systemdict dictionary, however by placing a new version into the userdict dictionary, operators can be practically overwritten because **the user-defined version is the first one found on the dictionary stack**. Using the startjob/exitserver operators, such changes can be made permanent – at least until the printer is restarted. A scheme of the PostScript dictionary stack is given below:

\
[![The PostScript dictionary stack](http://hacking-printers.net/wiki/images/thumb/f/ff/Dictstack.png/300px-Dictstack.png)](http://hacking-printers.net/wiki/index.php/File:Dictstack.png)

\
The **potential impact of redefining operators** is only limited by creativity. When further legitimate documents are printed and call a redefined operator, the attackers version will be executed. This can lead to a various attacks such as [denial of service](http://hacking-printers.net/wiki/index.php/Document\_processing#Showpage\_redefinition), print job [retention](http://hacking-printers.net/wiki/index.php/Print\_job\_retention) and [manipulation](http://hacking-printers.net/wiki/index.php/Print\_job\_manipulation). Note however that this is not necessarily a security bug, but a 32 years old language feature, available in almost any PostScript printer and [RIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster\_image\_processor).

### PCL

PCL 3 and PCL 4 added support for fonts and macros which both can be permanently downloaded to the device – however only referenced to by a numeric id, not by a file name, as **direct access to the file system is not intended**. PCL 1 to 5 consist of escape sequences followed by one or more ASCII characters representing a command to be interpreted. PCL 6 Enhanced or ‘PCL XL’ uses a binary encoded, object-oriented protocol. An **example PCL document to print ‘Hello world’ is given below**:

```
<Esc>Hello world
```

Due to its limited capabilities, PCL is **hard to exploit** from a security perspective unless one discovers interesting proprietary commands in some printer manufacturers's PCL flavour. The **PRET** tool implements a **virtual, PCL-based file system** which uses macros to **save file content and metadata in the printer's memory**. This hack shows that even a device which supports only minimalist page description languages like PCL can be used to store arbitrary files like copyright infringing material. Although turning a printer into a file sharing service is not a security vulnerability per se, it may apply as ‘misuse of service’ depending on the corporate policy.

## Misc Attacks

### USB drive or cable

Data can be sent to and received from a local printer by [USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB) or [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE\_1284) cables. Both channels are supported by **PRET** to communicate with the device. In addition, printers and MFPs often ship with Type-A USB ports which allows users to print directly from an USB device.\
While plugged-in USB drives do **not offer a bidirectional channel**, their usage in a crowded copy room may seem less conspicuous. Obviously, exploiting USB printers requires the attacker to gain physical access to the device. However, it is not completely unrealistic for most institutions and companies. Gaining physical access to printer can generally be considered as less hard than it is for other network components like servers or workstations.

### Cross-site printing

Abusing **client web request** an attacker can **abuse arbitrary printers** inside the internal network of the client connected to his malicious web page.\
[**Learn how can this be possible here.**](cross-site-printing.md)

### Abusing Spooler service in AD

If you can find any **Spool service listening** inside the domain, you may be able to **abuse** is to **obtain new credentials** and **escalate privileges**.\
[**More information about how to find a abuse Spooler services here.**](../../windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/printers-spooler-service-abuse.md)

## Privilege Escalation

[**Learn more here.**](scanner-and-fax.md)

## **Print job access**

### **Print Job Retention**

Jobs can be **retained in memory** and be **printed** again in a **later moment from the control panel**, or using **PostScript** you can even **remotely access all the jobs that are going to be printed, download them** and print them.\
[**Learn more here.**](print-job-retention.md)

### **Print Job Manipulation**

You can **add new content** to the pages that are printed, **change all the content** that is going to be printed or even **replace just certain letters or words.**\
[**Learn how to do it here.**](print-job-manipulation.md)

printer vendors have started to introduce the **possibility to install custom software on their devices** but information is not publicly available. The feature of writing customized software which runs on printers was intended and is reserved for resellers and contractors.\
[**Read more about this here.**](software-packages.md)

## **Denial of service**

### **Transmission channel**

Occupying all the **connections** and **increasing** the **timeout** of the server could lead to a DoS.\
[**Learn more about this here.**](transmission-channel.md)
