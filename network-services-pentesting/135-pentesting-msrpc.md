## Basic Information

The Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (MSRPC) protocol, a client-server model enabling a program to request a service from a program located on another computer without understanding the network's specifics, was initially derived from open-source software and later developed and copyrighted by Microsoft.

The RPC endpoint mapper can be accessed via TCP and UDP port 135, SMB on TCP 139 and 445 (with a null or authenticated session), and as a web service on TCP port 593.

```
135/tcp   open     msrpc         Microsoft Windows RPC
```

## How does MSRPC work?

Initiated by the client application, the MSRPC process involves calling a local stub procedure that then interacts with the client runtime library to prepare and transmit the request to the server. This includes converting parameters into a standard Network Data Representation format. The choice of transport protocol is determined by the runtime library if the server is remote, ensuring the RPC is delivered through the network stack.

## **Identifying Exposed RPC Services**

Exposure of RPC services across TCP, UDP, HTTP, and SMB can be determined by querying the RPC locator service and individual endpoints. Tools such as rpcdump facilitate the identification of unique RPC services, denoted by **IFID** values, revealing service details and communication bindings:

```
D:\rpctools> rpcdump [-p port] <IP>
**IFID**: 5a7b91f8-ff00-11d0-a9b2-00c04fb6e6fc version 1.0
Annotation: Messenger Service
UUID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Binding: ncadg_ip_udp:<IP>[1028]
```

Access to the RPC locator service is enabled through specific protocols: ncacn\_ip\_tcp and ncadg\_ip\_udp for accessing via port 135, ncacn\_np for SMB connections, and ncacn\_http for web-based RPC communication. The following commands exemplify the utilization of Metasploit modules to audit and interact with MSRPC services, primarily focusing on port 135:

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/dcerpc/endpoint_mapper
use auxiliary/scanner/dcerpc/hidden
use auxiliary/scanner/dcerpc/management
use auxiliary/scanner/dcerpc/tcp_dcerpc_auditor
rpcdump.py <IP> -p 135
```

All options except `tcp_dcerpc_auditor` are specifically designed for targeting MSRPC on port 135.

#### Notable RPC interfaces

* **IFID**: 12345778-1234-abcd-ef00-0123456789ab
* **Named Pipe**: `\pipe\lsarpc`

### Identifying IP addresses

Using [https://github.com/mubix/IOXIDResolver](https://github.com/mubix/IOXIDResolver), comes from [Airbus research](https://www.cyber.airbus.com/the-oxid-resolver-part-1-remote-enumeration-of-network-interfaces-without-any-authentication/) is possible to abuse the _**ServerAlive2**_ method inside the _**IOXIDResolver**_ interface.

This method has been used to get interface information as **IPv6** address from the HTB box _APT_. See [here](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2021/04/10/htb-apt.html) for 0xdf APT writeup, it includes an alternative method using rpcmap.py from [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/) with _stringbinding_ (see above).

### Executing a RCE with valid credentials

It is possible to execute remote code on a machine, if the credentials of a valid user are available using [dcomexec.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/dcomexec.py) from impacket framework.

**Remember to try with the different objects available**

* ShellWindows
* ShellBrowserWindow
* MMC20

## Port 593

The **rpcdump.exe** from [rpctools](https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/9780596510305/tree/master/tools/rpctools) can interact with this port.
