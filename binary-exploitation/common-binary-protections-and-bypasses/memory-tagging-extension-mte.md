## Basic Information

**Memory Tagging Extension (MTE)** is designed to enhance software reliability and security by **detecting and preventing memory-related errors**, such as buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities. MTE, as part of the **ARM** architecture, provides a mechanism to attach a **small tag to each memory allocation** and a **corresponding tag to each pointer** referencing that memory. This approach allows for the detection of illegal memory accesses at runtime, significantly reducing the risk of exploiting such vulnerabilities for executing arbitrary code.

### **How Memory Tagging Extension Works**

MTE operates by **dividing memory into small, fixed-size blocks, with each block assigned a tag,** typically a few bits in size.&#x20;

When a pointer is created to point to that memory, it gets the same tag. This tag is stored in the **unused bits of a memory pointer**, effectively linking the pointer to its corresponding memory block.

When a program accesses memory through a pointer, the MTE hardware checks that the **pointer's tag matches the memory block's tag**. If the tags **do not match**, it indicates an **illegal memory access.**

### MTE Pointer Tags

Tags inside a pointer are stored in 4 bits inside the top byte:

Therefore, this allows up to **16 different tag values**.

### MTE Memory Tags

Every **16B of physical memory** have a corresponding **memory tag**.

The memory tags are stored in a **dedicated RAM region** (not accessible for normal usage). Having 4bits tags for every 16B memory tags up to 3% of RAM.

ARM introduces the following instructions to manipulate these tags in the dedicated RAM memory:

```
STG [<Xn/SP>], #<simm>    Store Allocation (memory) Tag
LDG <Xt>, [<Xn/SP>]       Load Allocatoin (memory) Tag
IRG <Xd/SP>, <Xn/SP>      Insert Random [pointer] Tag
...
```

## Checking Modes

### Sync

The CPU check the tags **during the instruction executing**, if there is a mismatch, it raises an exception.\
This is the slowest and most secure.

### Async

The CPU check the tags **asynchronously**, and when a mismatch is found it sets an exception bit in one of the system registers. It's **faster** than the previous one but it's **unable to point out** the exact instruction that cause the mismatch and it doesn't raise the exception immediately, giving some time to the attacker to complete his attack.

## Implementation & Detection Examples

Called Hardware Tag-Based KASAN, MTE-based KASAN or in-kernel MTE.\
The kernel allocators (like `kmalloc`) will **call this module** which will prepare the tag to use (randomly) attach it to the kernel space allocated and to the returned pointer.

Note that it'll **only mark enough memory granules** (16B each) for the requested size. So if the requested size was 35 and a slab of 60B was given, it'll mark the first 16\*3 = 48B with this tag and the **rest** will be **marked** with a so-called **invalid tag (0xE)**.

The tag **0xF** is the **match all pointer**. A memory with this pointer allows **any tag to be used** to access its memory (no mismatches). This could prevent MET from detecting an attack if this tags is being used in the attacked memory.

Therefore there are only **14 value**s that can be used to generate tags as 0xE and 0xF are reserved, giving a probability of **reusing tags** to 1/17 -> around **7%**.

If the kernel access to the **invalid tag granule**, the **mismatch** will be **detected**. If it access another memory location, if the **memory has a different tag** (or the invalid tag) the mismatch will be **detected.** If the attacker is lucky and the memory is using the same tag, it won't be detected. Chances are around 7%

Another bug occurs in the **last granule** of the allocated memory. If the application requested 35B, it was given the granule from 32 to 48. Therefore, the **bytes from 36 til 47 are using the same tag** but they weren't requested. If the attacker access **these extra bytes, this isn't detected**.

When **`kfree()`** is executed, the memory is retagged with the invalid memory tag, so in a **use-after-free**, when the memory is accessed again, the **mismatch is detected**.

However, in a use-after-free, if the same **chunk is reallocated again with the SAME tag** as previously, an attacker will be able to use this access and this won't be detected (around 7% chance).

Moreover, only **`slab` and `page_alloc`** uses tagged memory but in the future this will also be used in `vmalloc`, `stack` and `globals` (at the moment of the video these can still be abused).

When a **mismatch is detected** the kernel will **panic** to prevent further exploitation and retries of the exploit (MTE doesn't have false positives).
