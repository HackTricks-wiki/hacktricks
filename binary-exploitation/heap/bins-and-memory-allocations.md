## Basic Information

In order to improve the efficiency on how chunks are stored every chunk is not just in one linked list, but there are several types. These are the bins and there are 5 type of bins: [62](https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=malloc/malloc.c;h=6e766d11bc85b6480fa5c9f2a76559f8acf9deb5;hb=HEAD#l1407) small bins, 63 large bins, 1 unsorted bin, 10 fast bins and 64 tcache bins per thread.

The initial address to each unsorted, small and large bins is inside the same array. The index 0 is unused, 1 is the unsorted bin, bins 2-64 are small bins and bins 65-127 are large bins.

### Tcache (Per-Thread Cache) Bins

Even though threads try to have their own heap (see [Arenas](bins-and-memory-allocations.md#arenas) and [Subheaps](bins-and-memory-allocations.md#subheaps)), there is the possibility that a process with a lot of threads (like a web server) **will end sharing the heap with another threads**. In this case, the main solution is the use of **lockers**, which might **slow down significantly the threads**.

Therefore, a tcache is similar to a fast bin per thread in the way that it's a **single linked list** that doesn't merge chunks. Each thread has **64 singly-linked tcache bins**. Each bin can have a maximum of [7 same-size chunks](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=malloc/malloc.c;h=2527e2504761744df2bdb1abdc02d936ff907ad2;hb=d5c3fafc4307c9b7a4c7d5cb381fcdbfad340bcc#l323) ranging from [24 to 1032B on 64-bit systems and 12 to 516B on 32-bit systems](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=malloc/malloc.c;h=2527e2504761744df2bdb1abdc02d936ff907ad2;hb=d5c3fafc4307c9b7a4c7d5cb381fcdbfad340bcc#l315).

**When a thread frees** a chunk, **if it isn't too big** to be allocated in the tcache and the respective tcache bin **isn't full** (already 7 chunks), **it'll be allocated in there**. If it cannot go to the tcache, it'll need to wait for the heap lock to be able to perform the free operation globally.

When a **chunk is allocated**, if there is a free chunk of the needed size in the **Tcache it'll use it**, if not, it'll need to wait for the heap lock to be able to find one in the global bins or create a new one.\
There also an optimization, in this case, while having the heap lock, the thread **will fill his Tcache with heap chunks (7) of the requested size**, so if case it needs more, it'll find them in Tcache.

### Fast bins

Fast bins are designed to **speed up memory allocation for small chunks** by keeping recently freed chunks in a quick-access structure. These bins use a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) approach, which means that the **most recently freed chunk is the first** to be reused when there's a new allocation request. This behavior is advantageous for speed, as it's faster to insert and remove from the top of a stack (LIFO) compared to a queue (FIFO).

Additionally, **fast bins use singly linked lists**, not double linked, which further improves speed. Since chunks in fast bins aren't merged with neighbours, there's no need for a complex structure that allows removal from the middle. A singly linked list is simpler and quicker for these operations.

Basically, what happens here is that the header (the pointer to the first chunk to check) is always pointing to the latest freed chunk of that size. So:

* When a new chunk is allocated of that size, the header is pointing to a free chunk to use. As this free chunk is pointing to the next one to use, this address is stored in the header so the next allocation knows where to get ana available chunk
* When a chunk is freed, the free chunk will save the address to the current available chunk and the address to this newly freed chunk will be put in the header

{% hint style="danger" %}
Chunks in fast bins aren't set as available so they are keep as fast bin chunks for some time instead of being able to merge with other free chunks surrounding them.

/*
   Fastbins

    An array of lists holding recently freed small chunks.  Fastbins
    are not doubly linked.  It is faster to single-link them, and
    since chunks are never removed from the middles of these lists,
    double linking is not necessary. Also, unlike regular bins, they
    are not even processed in FIFO order (they use faster LIFO) since
    ordering doesn't much matter in the transient contexts in which
    fastbins are normally used.

    Chunks in fastbins keep their inuse bit set, so they cannot
    be consolidated with other free chunks. malloc_consolidate
    releases all chunks in fastbins and consolidates them with
    other free chunks.
 */

typedef struct malloc_chunk *mfastbinptr;
#define fastbin(ar_ptr, idx) ((ar_ptr)->fastbinsY[idx])

/* offset 2 to use otherwise unindexable first 2 bins */
#define fastbin_index(sz) \
  ((((unsigned int) (sz)) >> (SIZE_SZ == 8 ? 4 : 3)) - 2)


/* The maximum fastbin request size we support */
#define MAX_FAST_SIZE     (80 * SIZE_SZ / 4)

#define NFASTBINS  (fastbin_index (request2size (MAX_FAST_SIZE)) + 1)
```

### Unsorted bin

The unsorted bin is a **cache** used by the heap manager to make memory allocation quicker. Here's how it works: When a program frees a chunk, and if this chunk cannot be allocated in a tcache or fast bin and is not colliding with the top chunk, the heap manager doesn't immediately put it in a specific small or large bin. Instead, it first tries to **merge it with any neighbouring free chunks** to create a larger block of free memory. Then, it places this new chunk in a general bin called the "unsorted bin."

When a program **asks for memory**, the heap manager **checks the unsorted bin** to see if there's a chunk of enough size. If it finds one, it uses it right away. If it doesn't find a suitable chunk in the unsorted bin, it moves all the chunks in this list to their corresponding bins, either small or large, based on their size.

Note that if a larger chunk is split in 2 halves and the rest is larger than MINSIZE, it'll be paced back into the unsorted bin.&#x20;

So, the unsorted bin is a way to speed up memory allocation by quickly reusing recently freed memory and reducing the need for time-consuming searches and merges.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note that even if chunks are of different categories, if an available chunk is colliding with another available chunk (even if they belong originally to different bins), they will be merged.
{% endhint %}

### Small Bins

Small bins are faster than large bins but slower than fast bins.

Each bin of the 62 will have **chunks of the same size**: 16, 24, ... (with a max size of 504 bytes in 32bits and 1024 in 64bits). This helps in the speed on finding the bin where a space should be allocated and inserting and removing of entries on these lists.

This is how the size of the small bin is calculated according to the index of the bin:

* Smallest size: 2\*4\*index (e.g. index 5 -> 40)
* Biggest size: 2\*8\*index (e.g. index 5 -> 80)

```c
// From https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/a07e000e82cb71238259e674529c37c12dc7d423/malloc/malloc.c#L1711
#define NSMALLBINS         64
#define SMALLBIN_WIDTH    MALLOC_ALIGNMENT
#define SMALLBIN_CORRECTION (MALLOC_ALIGNMENT > CHUNK_HDR_SZ)
#define MIN_LARGE_SIZE    ((NSMALLBINS - SMALLBIN_CORRECTION) * SMALLBIN_WIDTH)

#define in_smallbin_range(sz)  \
  ((unsigned long) (sz) < (unsigned long) MIN_LARGE_SIZE)

#define smallbin_index(sz) \
  ((SMALLBIN_WIDTH == 16 ? (((unsigned) (sz)) >> 4) : (((unsigned) (sz)) >> 3))\
   + SMALLBIN_CORRECTION)
```

Function to choose between small and large bins:

```c
#define bin_index(sz) \
  ((in_smallbin_range (sz)) ? smallbin_index (sz) : largebin_index (sz))
```

### Large bins

Unlike small bins, which manage chunks of fixed sizes, each **large bin handle a range of chunk sizes**. This is more flexible, allowing the system to accommodate **various sizes** without needing a separate bin for each size.

In a memory allocator, large bins start where small bins end. The ranges for large bins grow progressively larger, meaning the first bin might cover chunks from 512 to 576 bytes, while the next covers 576 to 640 bytes. This pattern continues, with the largest bin containing all chunks above 1MB.

Large bins are slower to operate compared to small bins because they must **sort and search through a list of varying chunk sizes to find the best fit** for an allocation. When a chunk is inserted into a large bin, it has to be sorted, and when memory is allocated, the system must find the right chunk. This extra work makes them **slower**, but since large allocations are less common than small ones, it's an acceptable trade-off.

There are:

* 32 bins of 64B range (collide with small bins)
* 16 bins of 512B range (collide with small bins)
* 8bins of 4096B range (part collide with small bins)
* 4bins of 32768B range
* 2bins of 262144B range
* 1bins of for reminding sizes

### Top Chunk

```c
// From https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/a07e000e82cb71238259e674529c37c12dc7d423/malloc/malloc.c#L1711

/*
   Top

    The top-most available chunk (i.e., the one bordering the end of
    available memory) is treated specially. It is never included in
    any bin, is used only if no other chunk is available, and is
    released back to the system if it is very large (see
    M_TRIM_THRESHOLD).  Because top initially
    points to its own bin with initial zero size, thus forcing
    extension on the first malloc request, we avoid having any special
    code in malloc to check whether it even exists yet. But we still
    need to do so when getting memory from system, so we make
    initial_top treat the bin as a legal but unusable chunk during the
    interval between initialization and the first call to
    sysmalloc. (This is somewhat delicate, since it relies on
    the 2 preceding words to be zero during this interval as well.)
 */

/* Conveniently, the unsorted bin can be used as dummy top on first call */
#define initial_top(M)              (unsorted_chunks (M))
```

Basically, this is a chunk containing all the currently available heap. When a malloc is performed, if there isn't any available free chunk to use, this top chunk will be reducing its size giving the necessary space.\
The pointer to the Top Chunk is stored in the `malloc_state` struct.

Moreover, at the beginning, it's possible to use the unsorted chunk as the top chunk.

### Last Reminder

When malloc is used and a chunk is divided (from the unlinked list or from the top chunk for example), the chunk created from the rest of the divided chunk is called Last Reminder and it's pointer is stored in the `malloc_state` struct.
