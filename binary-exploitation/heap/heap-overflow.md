## Basic Information

A heap overflow is like a [**stack overflow**](../stack-overflow/) but in the heap. Basically it means that some space was reserved in the heap to store some data and **stored data was bigger than the space reserved.**

In stack overflows we know that some registers like the instruction pointer or the stack frame are going to be restored from the stack and it could be possible to abuse this. In case of heap overflows, there **isn't any sensitive information stored by default** in the heap chunk that can be overflowed. However, it could be sensitive information or pointers, so the **criticality** of this vulnerability **depends** on **which data could be overwritten** and how an attacker could abuse this.

{% hint style="success" %}
In order to find overflow offsets you can use the same patters as in [**stack overflows**](../stack-overflow/#finding-stack-overflows-offsets).
{% endhint %}

## Example ARM64

In the page [https://8ksec.io/arm64-reversing-and-exploitation-part-1-arm-instruction-set-simple-heap-overflow/](https://8ksec.io/arm64-reversing-and-exploitation-part-1-arm-instruction-set-simple-heap-overflow/) you can find a heap overflow example where a command that is going to be executed is stored in the following chunk from the overflowed chunk. So, it's possible to modify the executed command by overwriting it with an easy exploit such as:

```bash
python3 -c 'print("/"*0x400+"/bin/ls\x00")' > hax.txt
```
